  # Thiss recipe needs a few things to build a useful output:
  # 1. New compilers. Not available on staged-recipes
  # 2. Extra time on Travis. Will need to request this seperately for the feedstock anyway
  #    Alternatively, we can build OSX on Azure.
  # 3. VS2017 for Windows (Pytorch refuses to build with MSVC2015 due to poor C++11 support)
  skip: true  # [not linux]
  # Needs modern GCC, the ones in conda-forge are too old
  {% if 'toolchain' in compiler('cxx') %}skip: True{% endif %}  # Only build with modern compilers.
  # Support for Windows and Python 2.7 is very experimental
