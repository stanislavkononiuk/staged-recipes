  summary: Contains functions used across packages 'QCA', 'DDIwR', and 'venn'. Interprets and
    translates SOP - Sum of Products expressions, for both binary and multi-value crisp
    sets, and extracts information (set names, set values) from those expressions. Other
    functions perform various other checks if possibly numeric (even if all numbers
    reside in a character vector) and coerce to numeric, or check if the numbers are
    whole. It also offers, among others, a highly flexible recoding function.
