  description: |
    The liac-arff module implements functions to read and write ARFF files in
    Python. It was created in the Connectionist Artificial Intelligence
    Laboratory (LIAC), which takes place at the Federal University of Rio Grande
    do Sul (UFRGS), in Brazil.

    ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) is an file format specially created
    for describe datasets which are used commonly for machine learning
    experiments and softwares. This file format was created to be used in Weka,
    the best representative software for machine learning automated experiments.
