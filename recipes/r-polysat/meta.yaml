  summary: A collection of tools to handle microsatellite data of any ploidy (and samples of
    mixed ploidy) where allele copy number is not known in partially heterozygous genotypes.  It
    can import and export data in ABI 'GeneMapper', 'Structure', 'ATetra', 'Tetrasat'/'Tetra',
    'GenoDive', 'SPAGeDi', 'POPDIST', 'STRand', and binary presence/absence formats.  It
    can calculate pairwise distances between individuals using a stepwise mutation model
    or infinite alleles model, with or without taking ploidies and allele frequencies
    into account.  These distances can be used for the calculation of clonal diversity
    statistics or used for further analysis in R.  Allelic diversity statistics and
    Polymorphic Information Content are also available.  polysat can  assist the user
    in estimating the ploidy of samples, and it can estimate allele  frequencies in
    populations, calculate pairwise or global differentiation statistics  based on those
    frequencies, and export allele frequencies to 'SPAGeDi' and 'adegenet'.   Functions
    are also included for assigning alleles to isoloci in cases where one pair  of microsatellite
    primers amplifies alleles from two or more independently segregating isoloci.  polysat
    is described by Clark and Jasieniuk (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.02985.x>
    and Clark and Schreier (2017) <doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12639>.
