  summary: 'A multilanguage implementation of Ctags'
  description: |
    Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in
    source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily located by
    a text editor or other utility. A tag signifies a language object for which
    an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index entry created
    for that object).
