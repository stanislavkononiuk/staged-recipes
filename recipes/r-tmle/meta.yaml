  summary: 'Targeted maximum likelihood estimation of point treatment effects (Targeted Maximum
    Likelihood Learning, The International Journal of biostatistics, 2(1), 2006.  This
    version automatically estimates the additive treatment effect among the treated
    (ATT) and among the controls (ATC).  The tmle() function calculates the adjusted
    marginal difference in mean outcome associated with a binary point treatment, for
    continuous or binary outcomes.  Relative risk and odds ratio estimates are also
    reported for binary outcomes. Missingness in the outcome is allowed, but not in
    treatment assignment or baseline covariate values.  The population mean is calculated
    when there is missingness, and no variation in the treatment assignment. The tmleMSM()
    function estimates the parameters of a marginal structural model for a binary point
    treatment effect. Effect estimation stratified by a binary mediating variable is
    also available. An ID argument can be used to identify repeated measures. Default
    settings call ''SuperLearner'' to estimate the Q and g portions of the likelihood,
    unless values or a user-supplied regression function are passed in as arguments. '
