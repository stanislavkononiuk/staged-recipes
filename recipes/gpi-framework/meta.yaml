  summary: "GPI - Graphical Programming Interface Development Framework"
  description:
    GPI is an integrated development environment for Python -- algorithm elements (i.e., nodes) can be linked together to form a flow diagram that is then executed according to the diagram hierarchy. At the node level, the common API and UI elements allow other developers to easily integrate and use your code. The visual and modular nature of GPI also allows concise communication of your work with your collaborators and provides an intuitive mechanism for others to start interacting with your research.
