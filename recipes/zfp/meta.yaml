  summary: 'Library for compressed numerical arrays that support high throughput read and write random access'
  description: |
    zfp is an open source C/C++ library for compressed numerical arrays
    that support high throughput read and write random access. zfp also
    supports streaming compression of integer and floating-point data,
    e.g., for applications that read and write large data sets to and
    from disk. zfp is primarily written in C and C++ but also includes
    Python and Fortran bindings.
