  summary: 'ICU data with R'
  description: |
    Working with ICU datasets, especially with publicly available ones as provided by
    PhysioNet in R is facilitated by ricu, which provides data access, a level of
    abstraction to encode clinical concepts in a data source agnostic way, as well as
    classes and utilities for working with the arising types of time series datasets.
