  summary: |
    Work with ''GitHub'' ''gists'' from ''R'' (e.g.,  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist>,  <https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/>).
    A ''gist'' is simply one or more files with code/text/images/etc. This package allows
    the user to create new ''gists'', update ''gists'' with new files, rename files,
    delete files, get and delete ''gists'', star and ''un-star'' ''gists'', fork ''gists'',
    open a ''gist'' in your default browser, get embed code for a ''gist'', list ''gist''
    ''commits'', and get rate limit information when ''authenticated''. Some requests
    require authentication and some do not.
