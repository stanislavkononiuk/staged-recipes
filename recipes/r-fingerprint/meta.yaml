  summary: Functions to manipulate binary fingerprints of arbitrary length. A fingerprint is
    represented by an object of S4 class 'fingerprint' which is internally represented
    a vector of integers, such that each element represents the position in the fingerprint
    that is set to 1. The bitwise logical functions in R are overridden so that they
    can be used directly with 'fingerprint' objects. A number of distance metrics are
    also available (many contributed by Michael Fadock). Fingerprints  can be converted
    to Euclidean vectors (i.e., points on the unit hypersphere) and can also be folded
    using OR.  Arbitrary fingerprint formats can be handled via line handlers. Currently
    handlers are provided for CDK, MOE and BCI fingerprint data.
