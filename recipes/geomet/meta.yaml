  summary: 'GeoMet - Convert GeoJSON to WKT/WKB, and vice versa'
  description: |
    Convert GeoJSON to WKT/WKB (Well-Known Text/Binary) or GeoPackage Binary,
    and vice versa. Extended WKB/WKT are also supported.
    Conversion functions are exposed through idiomatic load/loads/dump/dumps
    interfaces.
    The name "GeoMet" was inspired by "met", the German word for mead.
    It is also a shortened version of the word "geometry".
    GeoMet is intended to cover all common use cases for dealing with 2D,
    3D, and 4D geometries (including 'Z', 'M', and 'ZM').
