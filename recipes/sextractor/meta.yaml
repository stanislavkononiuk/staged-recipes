  summary: Extract catalogs of sources from astronomical images
  description: |
    SExtractor (Source-Extractor) is a program that builds a catalog of objects
    from an astronomical image. It is particularly oriented towards the
    reduction of large scale galaxy-survey data, but it also performs well on
    moderately crowded star fields.
