  summary: Interface to 'TensorFlow Probability', a 'Python' library built on 'TensorFlow' that
    makes it easy to combine probabilistic models and deep learning on modern hardware
    ('TPU', 'GPU'). 'TensorFlow Probability' includes a wide selection of probability
    distributions and bijectors, probabilistic layers, variational inference, Markov
    chain Monte Carlo, and optimizers such as Nelder-Mead, BFGS, and SGLD.
