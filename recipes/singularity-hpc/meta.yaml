  description: |
    Singularity Registry HPC (shpc) allows you to install containers as modules. 
    Currently, this includes:
     Lmod
     Environment Modules
     
    And container technologies:
      Singularity
      Podman
      Docker
    
    And coming soon:
      Shifter
      Sarus

    You can use shpc if you are:
      a linux administrator wanting to manage containers as modules for your cluster
      a cluster user that wants to maintain your own folder of custom modules
      a cluster user that simply wants to pull Singularity images as GitHub packages.

    The library contains a collection of module recipes that will install containers, 
    so you can easily use them or write your own. To see the code, head over to the repository. 
    To browse modules available as containers, see the library.
