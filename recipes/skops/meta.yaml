    `skops` is a Python library helping you share your 
    [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) based models 
    and put them in production. At the moment, it includes tools to easily 
    integrate models on the Hugging Face Hub, which allows you to share your 
    models, make them discoverable, and use the Hub's API inference and widgets 
    to get outputs of the model without having to download or load the model.
