    ``Causal ML`` is a Python package that provides a suite of uplift modeling and causal inference methods using machine learning algorithms based on recent research.
    It provides a standard interface that allows user to estimate the **Conditional Average Treatment Effect** (CATE) or **Individual Treatment Effect** (ITE) from experimental or observational data.
    Essentially, it estimates the causal impact of intervention **T** on outcome **Y** for users with observed features **X**, without strong assumptions on the model form.
