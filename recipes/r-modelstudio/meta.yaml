  summary: Automate the explanatory analysis of machine learning predictive models. Generate
    advanced interactive model explanations in the form of a serverless HTML site with
    only one line of code. This tool is model-agnostic, therefore compatible with most
    of the black-box predictive models and frameworks. The main function computes various
    (instance and model-level) explanations and produces a customisable dashboard, which
    consists of multiple panels for plots with their short descriptions. It is possible
    to easily save the dashboard and share it with others. Tools for Explanatory Model
    Analysis unite with tools for Exploratory Data Analysis to give a broad overview
    of the model behavior.
