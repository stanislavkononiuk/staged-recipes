  summary: "A rewrite of Python's builtin doctest module without all the weirdness (with pytest plugin integration)"

  description: |
    The xdoctest package is a re-write of Python's builtin doctest module.
    It replaces the old regex-based parser with a new abstract-syntax-tree
    based parser (using Python's ast module). The goal is to make doctests
    easier to write, simpler to configure, and encourage the pattern of test
    driven development.
