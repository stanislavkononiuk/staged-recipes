      summary: A metapackage to obtain a C compiler
      description: |
        This package is a generic way to obtain the C compiler for your system
        that conda-forge used to compile its ecosystem.  This compiler is,
        therefore, guaranteed to be ABI compatible with the conda packages
        you have installed.

        This compiler metapackage is a convenience ONLY for users.
        Do NOT use this package as a build or host dependency in other
        recipes.  Use the Jinja template function compiler('c') instead.
