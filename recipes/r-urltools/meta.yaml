  summary: A toolkit for all URL-handling needs, including encoding and decoding, parsing, parameter
    extraction and modification. All functions are designed to be both fast and entirely
    vectorised. It is intended to be useful for people dealing with web-related datasets,
    such as server-side logs, although may be useful for other situations involving
    large sets of URLs.
