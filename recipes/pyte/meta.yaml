  summary: 'Simple VTXXX-compatible linux terminal emulator'
  description: |
   pyte is an in memory VTXXX-compatible terminal emulator. XXX stands for a
   series of video terminals, developed by DEC between 1970 and 1995. The
   first, and probably the most famous one, was VT100 terminal, which is now a
   de-facto standard for all virtual terminal emulators. pyte follows the
   suit.
