  summary: Pure Python HDFS client
  description: |
    Port of snakebite for python 3.

    Snakebite is a python library that provides a pure python HDFS client and a
    wrapper around Hadoops minicluster. The client uses protobuf for
    communicating with the NameNode and comes in the form of a library and a
    command line interface. Currently, the snakebite client supports most
    actions that involve the Namenode and reading data from DataNodes.
