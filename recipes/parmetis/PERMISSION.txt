Subject: ParMetis Request

Hi George,

We are starting to have a pretty robust software stack for treating PDEs in
Python using the Anaconda distribution from Continuum. A key piece of this
would be hosting a ParMetis recipe on conda-forge with something like
share-alike permissions on redistribution (standard "redistribution must
include this copyright notice" stuff). Would this be alright with you?

I am Cc'ing the developers actually responsible for all the work.

  Thanks,

     Matt
