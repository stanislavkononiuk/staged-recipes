  description: |
    Snorkel is a system for rapidly creating, modeling, and managing training data.
    Users write programmatic operations to label, transform, and structure training
    datasets for machine learning, without needing to hand label any training data;
    Snorkel then uses modern, theoretically-grounded modeling techniques to clean and
    integrate the resulting training data.
