build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.

  description: |
    This package provides a command-line command and a corresponding importable function that strips type hints
    from Python code files. The stripping process leaves runnable code, assuming the rest of the code is runnable
     in the interpreter version. The program tries to make as few changes as possible to the processed code so that
      line and column numbers in error messages for the processed code file also correspond to those for
      the original code file. In most cases, with the default options, both the line and column numbers are preserved.
