  license: GPL-3.0-only
  summary: Set of tools to facilitate package development and make R a more user-friendly place.
    Mostly for developers (or anyone who writes/shares functions). Provides a simple,
    powerful and flexible way to check the arguments passed to functions. The developer
    can easily describe the type of argument needed. If the user provides a wrong argument,
    then an informative error message is prompted with the requested type and the problem
    clearly stated--saving the user a lot of time in debugging.
