  summary: 'Fast DP: Fast Data Processsing with XDS'
  description: |
    Fast DP is a small Python program which uses XDS, CCP4 & CCTBX
    to very quickly deliver data processing results for single-crystal
    X-ray crystallography experiments.
    Please note that you need to install XDS, CCP4, and CCTBX manually
    as they are not available as conda-forge packages.
