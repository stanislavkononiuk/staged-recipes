  summary: 'Measure river and stream surface velocity and river flow from UAV, smartphone or IP camera videos'
  description: |
    pyOpenRiverCam is an open-source API for estimating surface velocity and river flow from IP, drone or smartphone camera
    videos. It performs preprocessing, surface velocity estimation, spurious velocity filtering, cross section sampling, 
    infilling of missings, and integration to discharge. A user only needs to perform light field work and collect 
    videos. It is pure python code and therefore easy to take up in your own software project or perform research with or
    develop new features.
