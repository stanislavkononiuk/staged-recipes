  summary: Creating effective colour palettes for figures is challenging. This package generates
    and plot palettes of optimally distinct colours in perceptually uniform colour space,
    based on 'iwanthue' <http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/>. This is done
    through k-means clustering of CIE Lab colour space, according to user-selected constraints
    on hue, chroma, and lightness.
