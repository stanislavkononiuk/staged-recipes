  description: >
    Constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) methods are widely used
    for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and
    eukaryotes. COBRApy is a constraint-based modeling package that is
    designed to accommodate the biological complexity of the next generation of
    COBRA models and provides access to commonly used COBRA methods, such as
    flux-balance analysis, flux variability analysis, and gene deletion
    analyses.
