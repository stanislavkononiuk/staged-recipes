  summary: 'strip output from Jupyter and IPython notebooks'
  description: |
    Opens a notebook, strips its output, and writes the outputless version to the
    original file.

    Useful mainly as a git filter or pre-commit hook for users who don't want to
    track output in VCS.

    This does mostly the same thing as the `Clear All Output` command in the
    notebook UI.
