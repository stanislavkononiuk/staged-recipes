  summary: 'Simple ctypes bindings for FUSE - a fork of fusepy'
  description: |
    fusepyng is a Python module that provides a simple interface to FUSE on
    various operating systems. It's just one file and is implemented using
    ctypes.

    fusepyng is a fork of fusepy. We keep our code in sync with new code from
    there.
