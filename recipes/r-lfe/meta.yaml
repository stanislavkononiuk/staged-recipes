  summary: Transforms away factors with many levels prior to doing an OLS.  Useful for estimating
    linear models with multiple group fixed effects, and for estimating linear models
    which uses factors with many levels as pure control variables. Includes support
    for instrumental variables, conditional F statistics for weak instruments, robust
    and multi-way clustered standard errors, as well as limited mobility bias correction.
