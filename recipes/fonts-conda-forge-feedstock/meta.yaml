  summary: The curated conda-forge standard fonts
  description: |
    A basic set of different fonts with at least one font covering as many
    scientific glyphs as possible, looking native on Ubuntu, being suitable
    for UI applications like Qt Creator and RStudio and being all in all
    reasonable sized. Install more fonts via conda (e.g. mscorefonts) or your
    system's package manager for an increased font experience.
