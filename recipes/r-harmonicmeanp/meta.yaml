  summary: The harmonic mean p-value (HMP) test combines p-values and corrects for multiple testing
    while controlling the strong-sense family-wise error rate. It is more powerful than
    common alternatives including Bonferroni and Simes procedures when combining large
    proportions of all the p-values, at the cost of slightly lower power when combining
    small proportions of all the p-values. It is more stringent than controlling the
    false discovery rate, and possesses theoretical robustness to positive correlations
    between tests and unequal weights. It is a multi-level test in the sense that a
    superset of one or more significant tests is certain to be significant and conversely
    when the superset is non-significant, the constituent tests are certain to be non-significant.
    It is based on MAMML (model averaging by mean maximum likelihood), a frequentist
    analogue to Bayesian model averaging, and is theoretically grounded in generalized
    central limit theorem. For detailed examples type vignette("harmonicmeanp") after
    installation. Version 3.0 addresses errors in versions 1.0 and 2.0 that led function
    p.hmp to control the familywise error rate only in the weak sense, rather than the
    strong sense as intended.
