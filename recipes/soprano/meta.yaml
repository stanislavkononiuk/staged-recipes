  summary: 'A Python library to crack crystals'
  description: |
    Soprano is a Python library developed and maintained by the CCP for NMR
    Crystallography as a tool to help scientists working with crystallography and
    simulations to generate, manipulate, run calculations on and analyse large
    data sets of crystal structures, with a particular attention to the output of
    ab-initio random structure searching,
    or AIRSS. (https://www.mtg.msm.cam.ac.uk/Codes/AIRSS)

    It provides a number of functionalities to help automate many common tasks
    in computational crystallography.
