  summary: This is a utility for transforming Ecological Metadata Language ('EML') files into
    'JSON-LD' and back into 'EML.'  Doing so creates a list-based representation of
    'EML' in R, so that 'EML' data can easily be manipulated using standard 'R' tools.
    This makes this package an effective backend for other 'R'-based tools  working
    with 'EML.' By abstracting away the complexity of 'XML' Schema, developers can build
    around native 'R' list objects and not have to worry about satisfying many of the
    additional constraints of set by the schema (such as element ordering, which is
    handled automatically). Additionally, the 'JSON-LD'  representation enables the
    use of developer-friendly 'JSON' parsing and serialization that may facilitate the
    use of 'EML' in contexts outside of 'R,' as well as the informatics-friendly serializations
    such as 'RDF' and 'SPARQL' queries.
