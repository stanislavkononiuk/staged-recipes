  summary: "Read DBF files with Python."

  description: |
      DBF is a file format used by databases such dBase, Visual FoxPro, and
      FoxBase+. This library reads DBF files and returns the data as native
      Python data types for further processing. It is primarily intended for
      batch jobs and one-off scripts. This package is a fork of the project
      once developed by Ole Martin Bj√∏rndalen, and includes some additional
      functionality.
