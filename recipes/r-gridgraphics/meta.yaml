  summary: Functions to convert a page of plots drawn with the  graphics package into identical
    output drawn with the grid package. The result looks like the original graphics-based
    plot, but consists of grid grobs and viewports that can then be manipulated with  grid
    functions (e.g., edit grobs and revisit viewports).
