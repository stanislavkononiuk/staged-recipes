  summary: A Modern and Flexible 'Neo4J' Driver, allowing you to query data on a 'Neo4J' server
    and handle the results in R. It's modern in the sense it provides a driver that
    can be easily integrated in a data analysis workflow, especially by providing an
    API working smoothly with other data analysis and graph packages. It's flexible
    in the  way it returns the results, by trying to stay as close as possible to the
    way 'Neo4J' returns data. That way, you have the control over the way you will compute
    the results. At the same time, the result is not too complex, so that the "heavy
    lifting" of data wrangling is not left to the user.
