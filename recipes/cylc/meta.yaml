  summary: A workflow engine for cycling systems
  description: |
    Cylc is a general purpose workflow engine that orchestrates cycling
    workflows very efficiently. It was designed for production weather,
    climate, and environmental forecasting systems, but it is not
    specialized to those domains and is completely agnostic to the
    applications it manages.
