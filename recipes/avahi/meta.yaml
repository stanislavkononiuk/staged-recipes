      summary: "Python utility package for Avahi"
      description: |
        Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on
        a local network -- this means that you can plug your laptop or
        computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people who
        you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files being
        shared. This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X (branded
        'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf') and is very
        convenient.

        This package contains utility modules to talk to Avahi with Python easier.
