  summary: 'Programs for dealing with numbers from the Unix
    command line'
  description: |
    The 'num-utils' are a set of programs for dealing with numbers from the Unix
    command line. Much like the other Unix command line utilities like grep,
    awk, sort, cut, etc. these utilities work on data from both standard in and
    data from files.
