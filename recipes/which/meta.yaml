  summary: 'Shows the full path of (shell) commands'
  description: |
    Which takes one or more arguments. For each of its arguments it prints
    to stdout the full path of the executables that would have been exe-
    cuted when this argument had been entered at the shell prompt. It does
    this by searching for an executable or script in the directories listed
    in the environment variable PATH using the same algorithm as bash(1).
