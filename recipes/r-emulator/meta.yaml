  summary: Allows one to estimate the output of a computer program, as a function of the input
    parameters, without actually running it. The computer program is assumed to be a
    Gaussian process, whose parameters are estimated using Bayesian techniques that
    give a PDF of expected program output.  This PDF is conditional on a training set
    of runs, each consisting of a point in parameter space and the model output at that
    point.  The emphasis is on complex codes that take weeks or months to run, and that
    have a large number of undetermined input parameters; many climate prediction models
    fall into this class.  The emulator essentially determines Bayesian posterior estimates
    of the PDF of the output of a model, conditioned on results from previous runs and
    a user-specified prior linear model.  The package includes functionality to evaluate
    quadratic forms efficiently.
