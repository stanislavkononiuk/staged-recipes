  summary: A Python library to conjugate French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian verbs using Machine Learning techniques.

  description: "A Python library to conjugate verbs in French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian (more soon)\n    using Machine Learning techniques.\n\
      | Any verb in one of the supported language can be conjugated, as the module contains a Machine Learning model of how the verbs behave.\n| Even completely new or made-up verbs can be successfully conjugated\
      \ in this manner.\n| The supplied pre-trained models are composed of:\n\n- a binary feature extractor,\n- a feature selector using Linear Support Vector Classification,\n- a classifier using Stochastic\
      \ Gradient Descent.\n\n| MLConjug3 uses scikit-learn to implement the Machine Learning algorithms.\n| Users of the library can use any compatible classifiers from scikit-learn to modify and retrain the\
      \ models.\n\n| The training data for the french model is based on Verbiste https://perso.b2b2c.ca/~sarrazip/dev/verbiste.html .\n| The training data for English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian\
      \ was generated using unsupervised learning techniques\n  using the French model as a model to query during the training.\n\n\n* Free software: MIT license\n* Documentation: https://mlconjug3.readthedocs.io.\n\
      \nSupported Languages\n-------------------\n\n- French\n- English\n- Spanish\n- Italian\n- Portuguese\n- Romanian\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Easy to use API.\n- Includes pre-trained models with 99%\
      \ + accuracy in predicting conjugation class of unknown verbs.\n- Easily train new models or add new languages.\n- Easily integrate MLConjug3 in your own projects.\n- Can be used as a command line tool.\n
