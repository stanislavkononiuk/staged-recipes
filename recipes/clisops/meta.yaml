  summary: 'clisops - climate simulation operations'

  description: |
    The clisops package (pronounced "clie-sops") provides a python library for running
    data-reduction operations on xarray data sets or files
    that can be interpreted by xarray. These basic operations (subsetting, averaging and
    regridding) are likely to work where data structures are NetCDF-centric, such as those
    found in ESGF data sets.
