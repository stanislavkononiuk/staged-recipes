  summary: 'A scikit-learn compatible hyperbox-based machine learning library in Python'
  description: |
    hyperbox-brain is a Python open source toolbox implementing hyperbox-based machine learning algorithms
    built on top of scikit-learn and is distributed under the GPL-3.0 license. The project was started in
    2018 by Prof. Bogdan Gabrys and Dr. Thanh Tung Khuat at the Complex Adaptive Systems Lab - The University 
    of Technology Sydney. This project is a core module aiming to the formulation of explainable lifelong 
    learning systems in near future.
