  summary: "InChI: open-source chemical structure representation algorithm"
  description: |
    Originally developed by the International Union of Pure and Applied  Chemistry (IUPAC),
    the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) is a character string generated by
    computer algorithm. It is a tool to be used in software applications designed and
    developed by those who choose to use it.

    The InChI algorithm turns chemical structures into machine-readable strings of information.
    InChIs are unique to the compound they describe and can encode absolute stereochemistry
    making chemicals and chemistry machine-readable and discoverable. A simple analogy is that
    InChI is the bar-code for chemistry and chemical structures.
