  summary: Sophisticated scripter based on Tcl/Tk
  description: |
    Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet, ftp, passwd,
    fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect really makes this stuff trivial. Expect is also useful
    for testing these same applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive
    applications in X11 GUIs.
