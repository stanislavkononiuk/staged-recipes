  summary: Performs nearest neighbor-based imputation using one or more alternative  approaches
    to processing multivariate data. These include methods based on canonical  correlation
    analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and a multivariate adaptation  of the
    random forest classification and regression techniques of Leo Breiman and Adele  Cutler.
    Additional methods are also offered. The package includes functions for  comparing
    the results from running alternative techniques, detecting imputation targets  that
    are notably distant from reference observations, detecting and correcting  for bias,
    bootstrapping and building ensemble imputations, and mapping results.
