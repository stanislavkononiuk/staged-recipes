  description: |
    ncvue is a minimal GUI for a quick view of netCDF files. It is aiming to
    be a drop-in replacement for ncview and panoply, being slightly more
    general than ncview targeting only maps but providing animations, zooming
    and panning capabilities unlike panoply. If ncvue is used with maps,
    it supports mostly structured grids, more precisely the grids supported by
    cartopy.
