  summary: Implements the audit sampling workflow as discussed in Derks et al. (2019) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/9f6ub>.
    The package makes it easy for an auditor to plan a statistical sample, select the
    sample from the population, and evaluate the sample using various methods according
    to the International Standards on Auditing. Furthermore, the package implements
    Bayesian equivalents of these methods.
