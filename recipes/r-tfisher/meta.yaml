  summary: 'We provide the cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile, and statistical
    power calculator for a collection of thresholding Fisher''s p-value combination
    methods, including Fisher''s p-value combination method, truncated product method
    and, in particular, soft-thresholding Fisher''s p-value combination method which
    is proven to be optimal in some context of signal detection. The p-value calculator
    for the omnibus version of these tests are also included. For reference, please
