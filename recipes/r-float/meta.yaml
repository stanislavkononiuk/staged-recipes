  summary: R comes with a suite of utilities for linear algebra with "numeric" (double precision)
    vectors/matrices. However, sometimes single precision (or less!) is more than enough
    for a particular task.  This package extends R's linear algebra facilities to include
    32-bit float (single precision) data. Float vectors/matrices have half the precision
    of their "numeric"-type counterparts but are generally faster to numerically operate
    on, for a performance vs accuracy trade-off.  The internal representation is an
    S4 class, which allows us to keep the syntax identical to that of base R's. Interaction
    between floats and base types for binary operators is generally possible; in these
    cases, type promotion always defaults to the higher precision.  The package ships
    with copies of the single precision 'BLAS' and 'LAPACK', which are automatically
    built in the event they are not available on the system.

# Description: R comes with a suite of utilities for linear algebra with "numeric" (double precision) vectors/matrices.
