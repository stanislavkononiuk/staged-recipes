  summary: "S4 tool box for capacity (or non-additive measure, fuzzy measure) and integral manipulation
    in a finite setting. It contains routines for handling various types of set functions
    such as games or capacities. It can be used to compute several non-additive integrals:
    the Choquet integral, the Sugeno integral, and the symmetric and asymmetric Choquet
    integrals. An analysis of capacities in terms of decision behavior can be performed
    through the computation of various indices such as the Shapley value, the interaction
    index, the orness degree, etc. The well-known M\xF6bius transform, as well as other
    equivalent representations of set functions can also be computed. Kappalab further
    contains seven capacity identification routines: three least squares based approaches,
    a method based on linear programming, a maximum entropy like method based on variance
    minimization, a minimum distance approach and an unsupervised approach based on
    parametric entropies. The functions contained in Kappalab can for instance be used
    in the framework of multicriteria decision making or cooperative game theory."
