  summary: "Universal Python binding for the LMDB 'Lightning' Database"

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
    LMDB is a fast, memory-efficient, embedded key-value store (it does
    not require running an external daemon).
    With memory-mapped files, it has the read performance of a pure
    in-memory database while retaining the persistence of standard
    disk-based databases.
    python-lmdb is a Python binding for LMDB including a bundled
    version of LMDB.
