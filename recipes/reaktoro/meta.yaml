  summary: 'Unified framework for modeling chemically reactive systems'
  description: |
    Reaktoro is a unified framework for modeling chemically reactive systems.
    It provides methods for chemical equilibrium and kinetic calculations
    for multiphase systems. Reaktoro is mainly developed in C++ for
    performance reasons. A Python interface is available for a more
    convenient and simpler use. Currently, Reaktoro can interface with two
    widely used geochemical software, PHREEQC and GEMS.
