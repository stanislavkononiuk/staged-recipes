  summary: Brial - successor to PolyBoRi
  description: |
    The core of PolyBoRi is a C++ library, which provides high-level data
    types for Boolean polynomials and monomials, exponent vectors, as well
    as for the underlying polynomial rings and subsets of the powerset of
    the Boolean variables. As a unique approach, binary decision diagrams
    are used as internal storage type for polynomial structures. On top of
    this C++-library we provide a Python interface. This allows parsing of
    complex polynomial systems, as well as sophisticated and extendable
    strategies for Gröbner base computation. PolyBoRi features a powerful
    reference implementation for Gröbner basis computation.
