    patches:
      # These two patches are taken from the debian packaging of tinyxml.
      #   The first patch enforces use of stl strings, rather than a custom string type.
      #   The second patch is a fix for incorrect encoding of elements with special characters
      #   originally posted at https://sourceforge.net/p/tinyxml/patches/51/
      - enforce-use-stl.patch
