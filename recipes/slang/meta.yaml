  summary: 'S-Lang allows developers to create robust multi-platform software'

  description: |
    S-Lang is a multi-platform programmer's library designed to allow a
    developer to create robust multi-platform software. It provides facilities
    required by interactive applications such as display/screen management,
    keyboard input, keymaps, and so on. The most exciting feature of the library
    is the slang interpreter that may be easily embedded into a program to make
    it extensible. While the emphasis has always been on the embedded nature of
    the interpreter, it may also be used in a stand-alone fashion through the
    use of slsh, which is part of the S-Lang distribution.
