  patches:
    # Patch to allow cothread library to use libca from epicscorelibs.
    # Otherwise cothread expect an environment variable pointing to the
    # location of libca and expect an external libca to be available.
    # epicscorelibs provides libca as a Python package at conda-forge
    # and it is listed as a run dependency.
