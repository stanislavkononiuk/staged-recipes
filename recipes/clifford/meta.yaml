  description: |
    This module implements Geometric Algebras (a.k.a. Clifford algebras). Geometric Algebra (GA) is a universal algebra which subsumes complex algebra, quaternions, linear algebra and several other independent mathematical systems. Scalars, vectors, and higher-grade entities can be mixed freely and consistently in the form of mixed-grade multivectors.
