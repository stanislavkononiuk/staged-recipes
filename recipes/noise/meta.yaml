  summary: Perlin noise for Python
  description: "Perlin noise is ubiquitous in modern CGI. Used for procedural texturing,\nanimation, and enhancing realism, Perlin noise has been called the \"salt\" of\nprocedural content. Perlin noise\
    \ is a type of gradient noise, smoothly\ninterpolating across a pseudo-random matrix of values.\n\nThe noise library includes native-code implementations of Perlin \"improved\"\nnoise and Perlin simplex\
    \ noise. It also includes a fast implementation of\nPerlin noise in GLSL, for use in OpenGL shaders. The shader code and many of\nthe included examples require Pyglet (http://www.pyglet.org), the native-code\n\
    noise functions themselves do not, however.\n\nThe Perlin improved noise functions can also generate fBm (fractal Brownian\nmotion) noise by combining multiple octaves of Perlin noise. Shader functions\n\
    for convenient generation of turbulent noise are also included.\n\n- 1.2.2 AppVeyor support for Windows builds (Thanks to Federico Tomassetti)\n\n- 1.2.1 Fixes MSVC compatibility (Thanks to Christoph\
    \ Gohlke)\n\n- 1.2.0 adds 4D simplex noise, tiling for 2D simplex noise, \n  and parameterized lacunarity\n\nSee CHANGES.txt for more details"
