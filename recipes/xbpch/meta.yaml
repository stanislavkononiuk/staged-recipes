  summary: 'xarray interface for bpch files'

  description: |
    xpbch is a simple utility for reading the proprietary binary punch
    format (bpch) outputs used in versions of GEOS-Chem earlier than
    v11-02. The utility allows a user to load this data into an
    xarray/dask-powered workflow without necessarily pre-processing the
    data using GAMAP or IDL.
