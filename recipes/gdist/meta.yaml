  summary: 'Compute geodesic distances'
  description: |
    The `gdist` module is a Cython interface to a C++ library |
    (http://code.google.com/p/geodesic/) for computing |
    geodesic distance which is the length of shortest line between two |
    vertices on a triangulated mesh in three dimensions, such that the line |
    lies on the surface.
