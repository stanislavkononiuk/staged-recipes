  summary: Bayesian model averaging for linear models with a wide choice of (customizable) priors.
    Built-in priors include coefficient priors (fixed, flexible and hyper-g priors),
    5 kinds of model priors, moreover model sampling by enumeration or various MCMC
    approaches. Post-processing functions allow for inferring posterior inclusion and
    model probabilities, various moments, coefficient and predictive densities. Plotting
    functions available for posterior model size, MCMC convergence, predictive and coefficient
    densities, best models representation, BMA comparison.
