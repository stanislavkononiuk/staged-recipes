  summary: 'Tames problematic filenames'
  description: |
    detox is a program that renames files to make them easier to work with
    under Unix and related operating systems. Spaces and various other unsafe
    characters (such as "$") get replaced with "_". ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)
    characters can be transliterated to ASCII, as can UTF-8 characters.
    More details are contained in the detox.1 man page.
