  summary: Solves multivariate least squares (MLS) problems subject to constraints on the coefficients,
    e.g., non-negativity, orthogonality, equality, inequality, monotonicity, unimodality,
    smoothness, etc. Includes flexible functions for solving MLS problems subject to
    user-specified equality and/or inequality constraints, as well as a wrapper function
    that implements 24 common constraint options. Also does k-fold or generalized cross-validation
    to tune constraint options for MLS problems. See ten Berge (1993, ISBN:9789066950832)
    for an overview of MLS problems, and see Goldfarb and Idnani (1983) <doi:10.1007/BF02591962>
    for a discussion of the underlying quadratic programming algorithm.
