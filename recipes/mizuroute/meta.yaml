  summary: "Stand-alone streamflow routing model "

  description: |
    Stand-alone mizuRoute is a post-processor of runoff output from a hydrologic model
    or Land surface model to produce streamflow estimates in the river network provided
    by a user. The tool was developed for the large scale, network based river routing
    (e.g., river network over contiguous United States), but works for gridded river
    network as well.
