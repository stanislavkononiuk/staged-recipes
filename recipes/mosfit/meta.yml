  description: |
    mosfit is a package that performs fitting of semi-analytical model predictions
    to observed transient data. Data can be provided by the user, or can be pulled
    automatically from the Open Supernova Catalog by its name, and thus the code
    can be used to fit any supernova within that database, or any database that
    shares the format described in the OSC schema (such as the Open TDE Catalog
    or the Open Nova Catalog). With the use of an optional upload flag, fits
    performed by users can then be uploaded back to the aforementioned catalogs.
