  summary: Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining approaches from the 'forecast'
    package. Forecasts generated from auto.arima(), ets(), thetaf(), nnetar(), stlm(),
    tbats(), and snaive() can be combined with equal weights, weights based on in-sample
    errors (introduced by Bates & Granger (1969) <doi:10.1057/jors.1969.103>), or cross-validated
    weights. Cross validation for time series data with user-supplied models and forecasting
    functions is also supported to evaluate model accuracy.
