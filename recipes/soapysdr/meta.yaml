  summary: 'Vendor and platform neutral SDR support library'
  description: |
    SoapySDR is an open-source generalized API and runtime library for interfacing with
    SDR devices. With SoapySDR, you can instantiate, configure, and stream with an SDR
    device in a variety of environments. Most off the shelf SDR hardware platforms are
    supported by SoapySDR, and many open source applications rely on SoapySDR for
    hardware integration support. In additon, SoapySDR has bindings for development
    frameworks like GNU Radio and Pothos.
