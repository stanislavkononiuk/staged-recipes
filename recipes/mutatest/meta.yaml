  summary: 'Python mutation testing: test your tests!'
  description: |
    Are you confident in your tests?
    Try out mutatest and see if your tests will detect small modifications (mutations) in the code.
    Surviving mutations represent subtle changes that are undetectable by your tests.
    Mutatest modifies the pycache, not your source code, and has multiple running modes.
