  summary: 'CIF file support for Python'

  description: |
    PyCIFRW provides support for reading and writing CIF (Crystallographic
    Information Format) files using Python. It was developed at the Australian
    National Beamline Facility (ANBF), run by the Australian Synchrotron
    Research Program (ASRP), as part of a larger project to provide CIF
    input/output capabilities for data collection. It is now (Mar 2017)
    maintained and developed within the Australian Nuclear Science and
    Technology Organisation (ANSTO).
