  summary: A relay for bidirectional transfer between data channels (netcat++)

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
      socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data
      channels. Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe, device (serial line
      etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an
      SSL socket, proxy CONNECT connection, a file descriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU
      line editor (readline), a program, or a combination of two of these. 
      These modes include generation of "listening" sockets, named pipes, and pseudo
      terminals.

      socat can be used, e.g., as TCP port forwarder (one-shot or daemon), as an
      external socksifier, for attacking weak firewalls, as a shell interface to UNIX
      sockets, IP6 relay, for redirecting TCP oriented programs to a serial line, to
      logically connect serial lines on different computers, or to establish a
      relatively secure environment (su and  chroot) for running client or server
      shell scripts with network connections.
