  summary: This package computes the degrees of freedom of the lasso, elastic net, generalized
    elastic net and adaptive lasso based on the generalized path seeking algorithm.  The
    optimal model can be selected by model selection criteria including Mallows' Cp,
    bias-corrected AIC (AICc), generalized cross validation (GCV) and BIC.
