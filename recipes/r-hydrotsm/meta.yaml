  summary: S3 functions for management, analysis, interpolation and plotting of time series used
    in hydrology and related environmental sciences. In particular, this package is
    highly oriented to hydrological modelling tasks. The focus of this package has been
    put in providing a collection of tools useful for the daily work of hydrologists
    (although an effort was made to optimise each function as much as possible, functionality
    has had priority over speed). Bugs / comments / questions / collaboration of any
    kind are very welcomed, and in particular, datasets that can be included in this
    package for academic purposes.
