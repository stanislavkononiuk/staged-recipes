  summary: C++ API for the Linear Algebra PACKage

  description: |
    The Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) is a standard software library for
    numerical linear algebra. It provides routines for solving systems of
    linear equations and linear least squares problems, eigenvalue problems,
    and singular value decomposition. It also includes routines to implement
    the associated matrix factorizations such as LU, QR, Cholesky, etc.
    LAPACK was originally written in FORTRAN 77, and moved to Fortran 90 in
    version 3.2 (2008). LAPACK provides routines for handling both real and
    complex matrices in both single and double precision.
    The objective of LAPACK++ is to provide a convenient, performance oriented
    API for development in the C++ language, that, for the most part, preserves
    established conventions, while, at the same time, takes advantages of
    modern C++ features, such as: namespaces, templates, exceptions, etc.
    LAPACK++ is part of the SLATE project (Software for Linear Algebra
    Targeting Exascale), which is funded by the Department of Energy as part of
    its Exascale Computing Initiative (ECP). Closely related to LAPACK++ is the
    BLAS++ project, which provides a C++ API for BLAS and Batch BLAS.
