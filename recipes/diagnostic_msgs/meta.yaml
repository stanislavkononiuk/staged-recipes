  summary: |
    This package holds the diagnostic messages.
  description: |
    This package holds the diagnostic messages which provide the standardized
    interface for the diagnostic and runtime monitoring systems in ROS. These
    messages are currently used by the diagnostics Stack, which provides
    libraries for simple ways to set and access the messages, as well as
    automated ways to process the diagnostic data. These messages are used for
    long term logging and will not be changed unless there is a very important
    reason.
