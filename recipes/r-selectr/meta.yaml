  summary: Translates a CSS3 selector into an equivalent XPath expression. This allows us to
    use CSS selectors when working with the XML package as it can only evaluate XPath
    expressions. Also provided are convenience functions useful for using CSS selectors
    on XML nodes. This package is a port of the Python package 'cssselect' (<https://pythonhosted.org/cssselect/>).
