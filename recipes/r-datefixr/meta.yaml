  summary: 'There are many different formats dates are commonly represented with: the order of
    day, month, or year can differ, different separators ("-", "/", or whitespace) can
    be used, months can be numerical, names, or abbreviations and year given as two
    digits or four. ''datefixR'' takes dates in all these different formats and converts
    them to R''s built-in date class. If ''datefixR'' cannot standardize a date, such
    as because it is too malformed, then the user is told which date cannot be standardized
    and the corresponding ID for the row. ''datefixR'' also allows the imputation of
    missing days and months with user-controlled behavior.'
