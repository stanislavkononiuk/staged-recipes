  summary: A collection of tools for interactive manipulation of (spatial) data  layers on leaflet
    web maps. Tools include editing of existing layers, creation  of new layers through
    drawing of shapes (points, lines, polygons), deletion  of shapes as well as cutting
    holes into existing shapes. Provides control over  options to e.g. prevent self-intersection
    of polygons and lines or to enable/disable  snapping to align shapes.
