  summary: Methods to generate random gene-gene association networks and simulate RNA-seq data
    from them, as described in Grimes and Datta (2021) <doi:10.18637/jss.v098.i12>.
    Includes functions to generate random networks of any size and perturb them to obtain
    differential networks. Network objects are built from individual, overlapping modules
    that represent pathways. The resulting network has various topological properties
    that are characteristic of gene regulatory networks. RNA-seq data can be generated
    such that the association among gene expression profiles reflect the underlying
    network. A reference RNA-seq dataset can be provided to model realistic marginal
    distributions. Plotting functions are available to visualize a network, compare
    two networks, and compare the expression of two genes across multiple networks.
