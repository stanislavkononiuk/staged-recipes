  summary: GLobal IMPlicit SEarch
  description: |
     Glimpse, which stands for GLobal IMPlicit SEarch, is a very popular UNIX
     indexing and query system that allows you to search through a large set of
     files very quickly. Glimpse supports most of agrep's options (agrep is our
     powerful version of grep) including approximate matching (e.g., finding
     misspelled words), Boolean queries, and even some limited forms of regular
     expressions.
