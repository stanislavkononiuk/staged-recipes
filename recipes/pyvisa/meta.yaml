  summary: Control your instruments with Python.
  description: |
    PyVISA is a Python package that enables you to control all kinds of measurement devices 
    independently of the interface (e.g. GPIB, RS232, USB, Ethernet). As an example, reading 
    self-identification from a Keithley Multimeter with GPIB number 12 is as easy as three 
    lines of Python code:
