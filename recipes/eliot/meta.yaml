  summary: 'Causal logging for Python: the logging library that tells you why it happened'
  description: |
    Most logging systems tell you what happened in your application, whereas eliot also tells you why it happened. eliot is a Python logging system that outputs causal chains of actions: actions can spawn other actions, and eventually they either succeed or fail. The resulting logs tell you the story of what your software did: what happened, and what caused it.
