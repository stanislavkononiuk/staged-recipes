  summary: "The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library"
  description: |
    The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform open-source C/C++ 
    extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining 
    which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform. OpenGL core and extension 
    functionality is exposed in a single header file.
