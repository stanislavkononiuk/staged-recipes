  summary: 'Tokyo Cabinet is a high performance key-value store written in C.'

  description: |
     Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database.
     The database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair
     of a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with
     variable length. Both binary data and character string can be used as
     a key and a value. There is neither concept of data tables nor data
     types. Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or fixed-length
     array.

     Tokyo Cabinet is developed as the successor of GDBM and QDBM on the
     following purposes. They are achieved and Tokyo Cabinet replaces
     conventional DBM products.

       improves space efficiency : smaller size of database file.
       improves time efficiency : faster processing speed.
       improves parallelism : higher performance in multi-thread environment.
       improves usability : simplified API.
       improves robustness : database file is not corrupted even under catastrophic situation.
       supports 64-bit architecture : enormous memory space and database file are available.

     Tokyo Cabinet is written in the C language, and provided as API of
     C, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Lua. Tokyo Cabinet is available on platforms
     which have API conforming to C99 and POSIX. Tokyo Cabinet is a
     free software licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
