  description: |
    maml (MAterials Machine Learning) is a Python package that 
    aims to provide useful high-level interfaces that make ML 
    for materials science as easy as possible.
    The goal of maml is not to duplicate functionality already
    available in other packages. maml relies on well-established
    packages such as scikit-learn and tensorflow for 
    implementations of ML algorithms, as well as other materials
    science packages such as pymatgen and matminer for crystal/
    molecule manipulation and feature generation.
