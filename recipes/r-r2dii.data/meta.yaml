  summary: These datasets support the implementation in R of the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement
    Capital Transition Assessment), which is a free tool that calculates the alignment
    between corporate lending portfolios and climate scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
    Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital allocation decisions
    align with climate change mitigation goals. Because both financial institutions
    and market data providers keep their data private, this package provides fake, public
    data to enable the development and use of 'PACTA' in R.
