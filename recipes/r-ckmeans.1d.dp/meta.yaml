  summary: Fast, optimal, and reproducible weighted univariate clustering by dynamic programming.
    Four types of problem including univariate k-means, k-median, k-segments, and multi-channel
    weighted k-means are solved with guaranteed optimality and reproducibility. The
    core algorithm minimizes the sum of (weighted) within-cluster distances using respective
    metrics. Its advantage over heuristic clustering in efficiency and accuracy is pronounced
    at a large number of clusters k. Weighted k-means can also process time series to
    perform peak calling. Multi-channel weighted k-means groups multiple univariate
    signals into k clusters. An auxiliary function generates histograms that are adaptive
    to patterns in data. This package provides a powerful set of tools for univariate
    data analysis with guaranteed optimality, efficiency, and reproducibility.
