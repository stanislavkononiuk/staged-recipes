  description: |
      SarPy is a basic Python library to read, write, display, and do simple processing of complex SAR data using the
      NGA SICD format. It has been released by NGA to encourage the use of SAR data standards throughout the
      international SAR community. SarPy complements the SIX library (C++) and the MATLAB SAR Toolbox, which are
      implemented in other languages but have similar goals.

      Some sample SICD files can be found here.

      In addition to SICD, SarPy can also read COSMO-SkyMed, RADARSAT-2, Radar Constellation Mission (RCM), and
      Sentinel-1 SLC formats and convert them to SICD.

      Some examples of how to read complex SAR data using SarPy are provided in docs/sarpy_example.py.
