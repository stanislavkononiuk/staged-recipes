  summary: 'hrds is a python package for obtaining points from a set of rasters at different resolutions.'

  description: |
        hrds is a python package for obtaining points from a set of rasters at
        different resolutions. You can request a point (or list of points) and
        hrds will return a value based on the highest resolution dataset (as
        defined by the user) available at that point, blending datasets in a
        buffer region to ensure consistancy.
