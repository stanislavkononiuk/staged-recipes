  patches:
    # This patch does two things:
    #    - Doesn't use the flag -lm for searching for libpng on windows
    #    - Doesn't use libgimp in reading the rc file.
    #         I have no idea why I do'nt need to apply the second part of the
    #         patch for linux and mac seeing as they don't have gimp installed
    #         at compile time either.
