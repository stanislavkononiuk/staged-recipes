  summary: Efficiently calculate RMSDs for large structure sets
  license: MIT

  description: |
    pyRMSD is a small Python package that aims to offer an integrative
    and efficient way of performing RMSD calculations of large sets of
    structures. It is specially tuned to do fast collective RMSD
    calculations, as pairwise RMSD matrices.

    Note that this package does not currently include any CUDA calculators.

    See [the pyRMSD website](https://github.com/salilab/pyRMSD)
    and the [publication](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt402)
