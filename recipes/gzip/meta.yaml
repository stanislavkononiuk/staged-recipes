  summary: 'The GNU zip complession utility'
  description: |
    gzip (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement
    for 'compress'. Its main advantages over compress are much better
    compression and freedom from patented algorithms.  The GNU Project
    uses it as the standard compression program for its system.
