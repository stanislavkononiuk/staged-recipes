  summary: 'Rapidly understand solvation with MDAnalysis.'
  description: |
    Solvation analysis implements a robust, cohesive, and fast set of
    methods for analyzing the solvation structure of a liquid. It seamlessly
    integrates with MDAnalysis, making use of the core AtomGroup and Universe
    data structures to parse solvation information. If you are interested in
    understanding the solvation structure of a liquid, this package is for you!
