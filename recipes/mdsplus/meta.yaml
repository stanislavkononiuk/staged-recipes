  summary: MDSplus data management system
  description: |
    MDSplus is a set of software tools for data acquisition and
    storage and a methodology for management of complex
    scientific data.

    MDSplus allows all data from an experiment or simulation
    code to be stored into a single, self-descriptive,
    hierarchical structure. The system was designed to enable
    users to easily construct complete and coherent data sets.

    The MDSplus programming interface contains only a few basic
    commands, simplifyng data access even into complex
    structures. Using the client/server model, data at remote
    sites can be read or written without file transfers.
    MDSplus includes x-windows and java tools for viewing data
    or for modifying or viewing the underlying structures.
