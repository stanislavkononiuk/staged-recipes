  summary: 'Provides the Python DataModelDict class for creating, accessing and manipulating JSON/XML data structures.'

  description: |
    The DataModelDict class is used for handling data models that have 
    equivalent representations in XML, JSON, and Python. Constructing 
    data models in this way is convenient as it supports compatibility 
    across different software tools, such as different types of databases.
