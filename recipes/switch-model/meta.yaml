  summary: 'A modern platform for planning high-renewable power systems'

  description: |
    Switch 2.0 is an open-source modeling platform for planning transitions to
    low-emission electric power grids, designed to satisfy 21st century grid
    planning requirements. Switch is capable of long-, medium- and short-term
    planning of investments and operations with conventional or smart grids,
