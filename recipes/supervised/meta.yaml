  summary: Automated Machine Learning Pipeline with Feature Engineering and Hyper-Parameters Tuning
  description: |
    The mljar-supervised is an Automated Machine Learning Python package that works with tabular data. 
    It is designed to save time for a data scientist. It abstracts the common way to preprocess the data, 
    construct the machine learning models, and perform hyper-parameters tuning to find the best model trophy. 
    It is no black-box as you can see exactly how the ML pipeline is constructed (with a detailed Markdown report for each ML model).
