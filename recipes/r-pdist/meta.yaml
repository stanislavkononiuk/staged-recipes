  summary: Computes the euclidean distance between rows of a matrix X and rows of another matrix
    Y.  Previously, this could be done by binding the two matrices together and calling
    'dist', but this creates unnecessary computation by computing the distances between
    a row of X and another row of X, and likewise for Y. pdist strictly computes distances
    across the two matrices, not within the same matrix, making computations significantly
    faster for certain use cases.
