  summary: 'Information about path configuration in Morepath'
  description: |
    more.pathtool lets you create a tool that generates information about paths
    in a Morepath application. This way you can see exactly what paths a
    Morepath application supports, including views and mounted applications. It
    does this by reading the configuration information of a Morepath
    application.
