  summary: 'Python bindings for Embree 3'
  description: |
    This library is a thin wrapper around Embree 3.
    As much as possible, it tries to emulate the C API usage.
    The main point of this is to avoid creating a new API which
    would obfuscate the usage of the C API. Ideally, it should be
    easy to read the Embree documentation or examples, and translate
    things straightforwardly to equivalent Python code.
    A secondary goal is to provide easy interoperability with numpy.
