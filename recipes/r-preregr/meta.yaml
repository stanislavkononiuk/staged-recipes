  summary: Preregistrations, or more generally, registrations, enable explicit timestamped and
    (often but not necessarily publicly) frozen documentation of plans and expectations
    as well as decisions and justifications. In research, preregistrations are commonly
    used to clearly document plans and facilitate justifications of deviations from
    those plans, as well as decreasing the effects of publication bias by enabling identification
    of research that was conducted but not published. Like reporting guidelines, (pre)registration
    forms often have specific structures that facilitate systematic reporting of important
    items. The 'preregr' package facilitates specifying (pre)registrations in R and
    exporting them to a human-readable format (using R Markdown partials or exporting
    to an 'HTML' file) as well as human-readable embedded data (using 'JSON'), as well
    as importing such exported (pre)registration specifications from such embedded 'JSON'.
