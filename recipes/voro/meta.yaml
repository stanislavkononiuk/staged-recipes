  summary: |
    Voro++, a 3D cell-based Voronoi library (http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/)
  description: |
    Voro++ is a software library for carrying out three-dimensional computations
    of the Voronoi tessellation. A distinguishing feature of the Voro++ library
    is that it carries out cell-based calculations, computing the Voronoi cell
    for each particle individually, rather than computing the Voronoi
    tessellation as a global network of vertices and edges. It is particularly
    well-suited for applications that rely on cell-based statistics, where
    features of Voronoi cells (e.g. volume, centroid, number of faces) can be
    used to analyze a system of particles.
