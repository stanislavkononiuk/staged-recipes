  summary: Designed with a dual purpose of accurately estimating the mode (or modes) as well
    as characterizing the modality of data. The specific application area includes complex
    or mixture distributions particularly in a big data environment. The heterogeneous
    nature of (big) data may require deep introspective statistical and machine learning
    techniques, but these statistical tools often fail when applied without first understanding
    the data. In small datasets, this often isn't a big issue, but when dealing with
    large scale data analysis or big data thoroughly inspecting each dimension typically
    yields an O(n^n-1) problem. As such, dealing with big data require an alternative
    toolkit. This package not only identifies the mode or modes for various data types,
    it also provides a programmatic way of understanding the modality (i.e. unimodal,
    bimodal, etc.) of a dataset (whether it's big data or not). See <http://www.sdeevi.com/modes_package>
    for examples and discussion.
