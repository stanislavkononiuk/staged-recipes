  summary: 'A PEG Parser-Interpreter in Python'

  description: |
    Python is a nice scripting language. It even gives you access to its own parser and compiler.
    It also gives you access to different other parsers for special purposes like XML and string templates.
    But sometimes you may want to have your own parser. This is what's pyPEG for. And pyPEG supports Unicode.
