  summary: A graphics device for R that is accessible via network protocols. This package was
    created to make it easier to embed live R graphics in integrated development environments
    and other applications. The included 'HTML/JavaScript' client (plot viewer) aims
    to provide a better overall user experience when dealing with R graphics. The device
    asynchronously serves graphics via 'HTTP' and 'WebSockets'.
