  summary: 'A Jupyter Notebook magic for browser notifications of cell completion'
  description: |
    This package provides a Jupyter notebook cell magic %%notify that notifies
    the user upon completion of a potentially long-running cell via a browser
    push notification. Use cases include long-running machine learning models,
    grid searches, or Spark computations. This magic allows you to navigate
    away to other work (or even another Mac desktop entirely) and still get a
    notification when your cell completes. Clicking on the body of the
    notification will bring you directly to the browser window and tab with
    the notebook, even if you're on a different desktop (clicking the "Close"
    button in the notification will keep you where you are).
