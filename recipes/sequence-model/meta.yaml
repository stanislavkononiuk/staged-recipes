  description: |
    Sequence is a modular 2D (i.e., profile) sequence stratigraphic
    model that is written in Python and implemented within the
    Landlab framework. Sequence represents time-averaged fluvial
    and marine sediment transport via differential equations. The
    modular code includes components to deal with sea level changes,
    sediment compaction, local or flexural isostasy, and tectonic
    subsidence and uplift.
