  summary: R interface to the Embedded COnic Solver (ECOS), an efficient and robust C library
    for convex problems. Conic and equality constraints can be specified in addition
    to integer and boolean variable constraints for mixed-integer problems. This R interface
    is inspired by the python interface and has similar calling conventions.
