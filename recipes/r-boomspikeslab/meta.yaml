  summary: Spike and slab regression with a variety of residual error distributions corresponding
    to Gaussian, Student T, probit, logit, SVM, and a few others.  Spike and slab regression
    is Bayesian regression with prior distributions containing a point mass at zero.  The
    posterior updates the amount of mass on this point, leading to a posterior distribution
    that is actually sparse, in the sense that if you sample from it many coefficients
    are actually zeros.  Sampling from this posterior distribution is an elegant way
    to handle Bayesian variable selection and model averaging.  See <DOI:10.1504/IJMMNO.2014.059942>
    for an explanation of the Gaussian case.
