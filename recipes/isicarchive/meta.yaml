  summary: 'ISIC Archive API'
  description: |
    The ISIC Archive is an online repository and archive published and
    maintained by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration. Next to
    the human-readable and browsable website, it also provides a publicly
    available API, which offers several functions (called endpoints) for
    interacting with the data programmatically.
    The present python package is an attempt at bundling the more
    frequently used functionality into a single module, thus reducing the
    need to re-write certain code for a diverse set of projects.
