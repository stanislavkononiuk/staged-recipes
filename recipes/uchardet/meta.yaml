  summary: 'An encoding detector library that attempts to determine the encoding of the text'
  description: |
    uchardet is an encoding detector library, which takes a sequence of bytes in an
    unknown character encoding without any additional information, and attempts to
    determine the encoding of the text. Returned encoding names are iconv-compatible.
    uchardet started as a C language binding of the original C++ implementation of
    the universal charset detection library by Mozilla. It can now detect more charsets,
    and more reliably than the original implementation.
