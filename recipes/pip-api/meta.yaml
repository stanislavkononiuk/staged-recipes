  description: |
    Since [`pip`](https://pypi.org/p/pip) is a command-line-tool, [it does not have
    an official, supported, _importable_
    API](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#using-pip-from-your-program).

    However, this does not mean that people haven't tried to `import pip`, usually
    to end up with much headache when `pip`'s maintainers do routine refactoring.

    This project attempts to provide an importable `pip` API, which is _fully
    compliant_ with the recommended method of using `pip` from your program.
