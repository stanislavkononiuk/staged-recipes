      summary: "HTCondor's classified advertisement language"
      description: |
        Classified Advertisements (classads) are the lingua franca of
        HTCondor. They are used for describing jobs, workstations, and other
        resources. They are exchanged by HTCondor processes to schedule
        jobs. They are logged to files for statistical and debugging
        purposes. They are used to enquire about current state of the system.

        A classad is a mapping from attribute names to expressions. In the
        simplest cases, the expressions are simple constants (integer,
        floating point, or string). A classad is thus a form of property
        list. Attribute expressions can also be more complicated. There is a
        protocol for evaluating an attribute expression of a classad vis a vis
        another ad. For example, the expression "other.size > 3" in one ad
        evaluates to true if the other ad has an attribute named size and the
        value of that attribute is (or evaluates to) an integer greater than
        three. Two classads match if each ad has an attribute requirements
        that evaluates to true in the context of the other ad. Classad
        matching is used by the HTCondor central manager to determine the
        compatibility of jobs and workstations where they may be run.
