  summary: A collection of tools to evaluate probability density functions, cumulative distribution
    functions, quantile functions and random numbers for truncated random variables.  These
    functions are provided to also compute the expected value and variance. Nadarajah
    and Kotz (2006) developed most of the functions. QQ plots can be produced. All the
    probability functions in the stats, stats4 and evd packages are automatically available
    for truncation..
