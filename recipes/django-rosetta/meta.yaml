  summary: 'A Django application that eases the translation of Django projects'

  description: |
  Rosetta is a Django application that eases the translation process of your Django projects.
  Because it doesn't export any models, Rosetta doesn't create any tables in your project's database. 
  Rosetta can be installed and uninstalled by simply adding and removing a single entry in your project's INSTALLED_APPS and a single line in your main urls.py file.
  
  Note: as of version 0.7.13 django-rosetta requires Django 1.8 or later. As of version 0.9.0, django-rosetta requires Django 1.11 or later.
