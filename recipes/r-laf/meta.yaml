  summary: 'Methods for fast access to large ASCII files.  Currently the following file formats
    are supported: comma separated format (CSV) and fixed width format. It is assumed
    that the files are too large to fit into memory, although the package can also be
    used to efficiently access files that do fit into memory. Methods are provided to
    access and process files blockwise. Furthermore, an opened file can be accessed
    as one would an ordinary data.frame. The LaF vignette gives an overview of the functionality
    provided.'
