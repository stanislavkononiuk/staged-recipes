  summary: 'KIM-EDN encoder and decoder for Python'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    KIM-EDN encoder and decoder embraces a subset of
    edn <https://openkim.org/doc/schema/edn-format> as a standard data
    format. The primary purpose of this data format choice is to serve as a
    notational superset to JSON with the enhancements being that it (1)
    allows for comments and (2) treats commas as whitespace enabling easier
    templating. KIM-EDN encoder and decoder works for Python 3.6+. It is pure
    Python code with no dependencies.
