  summary: PARI database needed by ellap for large primes.
  description: |
    These polynomials were extracted from the ECHIDNA databases and computed by
    David R. Kohel. This covers finite fields of cardinality q up to 750 bits.
    PARI/GP 2.9 contains fallback code to go on when all modular polynomials in
    the database have been exhausted and can handle larger fields
    (with an important slowdown).
