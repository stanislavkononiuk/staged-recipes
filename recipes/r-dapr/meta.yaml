  summary: An easy-to-use, dependency-free set of functions for iterating over elements of various
    input objects. Functions are wrappers around base apply()/lapply()/vapply() functions
    but designed to have similar functionality to the mapping functions in the 'purrr'
    package <https://purrr.tidyverse.org/>. Specifically, function names more explicitly
    communicate the expected class of the output and functions also allow for the convenient
    shortcut of '~ .x' instead of the more verbose 'function(.x) .x'.
