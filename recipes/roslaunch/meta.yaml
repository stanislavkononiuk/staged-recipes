  description: |
    roslaunch is a tool for easily launching multiple ROS nodes locally and
    remotely via SSH, as well as setting parameters on the Parameter Server. It
    includes options to automatically respawn processes that have already died.
    roslaunch takes in one or more XML configuration files (with the .launch
    extension) that specify the parameters to set and nodes to launch, as well
    as the machines that they should be run on.
