  summary: A command line tool that facilitates building OCI container images.
  description: |
    The Buildah package provides a command line tool which can be used to:

      * Create a working container, either from scratch or using an image as a starting point.
      * Mount a working container's root filesystem for manipulation.
      * Unmount a working container's root filesystem.
      * Use the updated contents of a container's root filesystem as a filesystem layer to create a new image.
      * Delete a working container or an image.
      * Rename a local container.
