  summary: A package for analyzing Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) data
  description: |
      This is a python package for processing and visualizing SP2 data. It is based
      off of the IGOR code developed by Droplet Measurement Technologies.
      PySP2 currently supports processing all raw SP2 data (.sp2b, .hk, .ini) files 
      into mass and number size distributions. It can plot individual waveforms as
      well as particle size distributions. Its file format is based off of the standard
      provided by the Atmospheric Community Toolkit which is based around xarray.
      PySP2 is currently used by the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation
      Measurment (ARM) Facility in order to process SP2 observations during field
      deployments such as TRACER and SAIL.
