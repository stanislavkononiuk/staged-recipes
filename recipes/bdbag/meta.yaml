  description: |
    The bdbag utilities are a collection of software programs for working with BagIt packages that conform to the BDBag and Bagit/RO profiles.

    The bdbag profiles specify the use of the fetch.txt file, require serialization, and specify what manifests must be provided with a bdbag.

    These utilities combine various other components such as the Bagit-Python bag creation utility and the Bagit-Profiles-Validator utility into a single, easy to use software package.
