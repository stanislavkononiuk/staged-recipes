  summary: The Community Diagnostics Package (CDP) is a framework for developing new climate diagnostics. CDP allows for a modular implementation of the components required for running diagnostics. The design of CDP consists of modules to handle the user-defined parameters, metrics, provenance, file I/O, output of results and algorithms for calculating the diagnostics.
