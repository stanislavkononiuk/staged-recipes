  summary: "Processing and modeling gravity and magnetic data"
  description: |
    Harmonica is a Python library for processing and modeling gravity and
    magnetic data. It includes common processing steps, like calculation of
    Bouguer and terrain corrections, reduction to the pole, upward
    continuation, equivalent layers, and more. There are forward modeling
    functions for basic geometric shapes, like spheres, prisms, polygonal
    prisms, and tesseroids. The inversion methods are implemented as classes
    with an interface inspired by scikit-learn (like Verde).
