  summary: The fit.models function and its associated methods (coefficients, print, summary,
    plot, etc.) were originally provided in the robust package to compare robustly and
    classically fitted model objects. The aim of the fit.models package is to separate
    this fitted model object comparison functionality from the robust package and to
    extend it to support fitting methods (e.g., classical, robust, Bayesian, regularized,
    etc.) more generally.
