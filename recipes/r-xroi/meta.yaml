  summary: Digital repeat photography and near-surface remote sensing have been used by environmental
    scientists to study the environmental change for nearly a decade. However, a user-friendly,
    reliable, and robust platform to extract color-based statistics and time-series
    from a large stack of images is still lacking. Here, we present an interactive open-source
    toolkit, called 'xROI', that facilitate the process time-series extraction and improve
    the quality of the final data. 'xROI' provides a responsive environment for scientists
    to interactively a) delineate regions of interest (ROI), b) handle field of view
    (FOV) shifts, and c) extract and export time series data characterizing image color
    (i.e. red, green and blue channel digital numbers for the defined ROI). Using 'xROI',
    user can detect FOV shifts without minimal difficulty. The software gives user the
    opportunity to readjust the mask files or redraw new ones every time an FOV shift
    occurs. 'xROI' helps to significantly improve data accuracy and continuity.
