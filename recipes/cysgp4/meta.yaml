  summary: 'Cysgp4 is a wrapper around the SGP4 package, for sat TLE calculations'
  description: |
      The cysgp4 package is a Cython-powered wrapper of the sgp4 C++ library
      by Daniel Warner to compute satellite positions from two-line elements
      (TLE). It provides similar functionality as the well-known sgp4 Python
      package by Brandon Rhodes, which uses Numba internally to speed-up the
      calculations. In contrast to sgp4, cysgp4 can work well with arrays of
      TLEs and/or times and make use of multi-core platforms (via OpenMP) to
      boost processing times a lot.
