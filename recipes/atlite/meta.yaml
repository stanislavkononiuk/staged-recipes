  summary: Atlite converts climate weather data for Power Systems Analysis
  description: |
      Atlite is a free software, xarray-based Python library for converting
      weather data (such as wind speeds, solar radiation, temperature and
      runoff) into power systems data (such as wind power, solar power, hydro
      power and heating demand time series). It is designed to work with big
      datasets, such as hourly global weather data over several years at spatial
      resolutions down to e.g. 0.1 x 0.1 degree resolution.
