  license: GPL-2
  summary: Provides a wrapper for the download.file function, making it possible to download
    files over HTTPS on Windows, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like platforms. The 'RCurl'
    package provides this functionality (and much more) but can be difficult to install
    because it must be compiled with external dependencies. This package has no external
    dependencies, so it is much easier to install.
