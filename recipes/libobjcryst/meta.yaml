  description: |
    ObjCryst++ repackaged for installation as a system shared library.
    ObjCryst++ is Object-Oriented Crystallographic Library for C++ developed
    by Vincent Favre-Nicolin. libobjcryst is a mirror of the ObjCryst++
    sources from https://sourceforge.net/projects/objcryst, expanded with
    SCons build scripts to make it easier to install as a system shared
    library. libobjcryst does not include GUI related files from ObjCryst++.
    This distribution contains required sources from cctbx and newmat that are
    used in ObjCryst++.
