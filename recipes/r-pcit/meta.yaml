  summary: Apply Partial Correlation coefficient with Information Theory (PCIT) to a correlation
    matrix. The PCIT algorithm identifies meaningful correlations to define edges in
    a weighted network. The algorithm can be applied to any correlation-based network
    including but not limited to gene co-expression networks. To reduce compute time
    by making use of multiple compute cores, simply run PCIT on a computer with has
    multiple cores and also has the Rmpi package installed. PCIT will then auto-detect
    the multicore environment and run in parallel mode without the need to rewrite your
    scripts. This makes scripts, using PCIT, portable across single core (or no Rmpi
    package installed) computers which will run in serial mode and multicore (with Rmpi
    package installed) computers which will run in parallel mode.
