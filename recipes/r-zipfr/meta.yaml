  summary: Statistical models and utilities for the analysis of word frequency distributions.
    The utilities include functions for loading, manipulating and visualizing word frequency
    data and vocabulary growth curves.  The package also implements several statistical
    models for the distribution of word frequencies in a population.  (The name of this
    package derives from the most famous word frequency distribution, Zipf's law.)
