  description: |
    looseversion is a drop-in replacement for the original distutils.version.LooseVersion.
    It implements an identical interface and comparison logic to `LooseVersion`.
    The only major change is that a `looseversion.LooseVersion` is comparable to a
    `distutils.version.LooseVersion`, which means tools should not need to worry whether
    all dependencies that use LooseVersion have migrated.
