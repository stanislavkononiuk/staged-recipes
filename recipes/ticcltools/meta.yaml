    The main programs in this colection are:
    * TICCL-indexer and TICCL-indexerNT:
      a tool to create an exhaustive index to all lexical variants given a particular Levenshtein or edit distance in a corpus.
    * TICCL-anahash:
      a tool to create anagram hashes form a word frequency file. Also creates ab 'alphabet' file of the unicode characters that are present in the corpus.
    * TICCL-LDcalc:
      a proprocessing tool for TICCL-rank. Gathers the info from TICC-anahash, TICCL-indexer, TICCL-lexstat and TICCL-unk
    * TICCL-rank:
      ranks a word varian list according to al lot of criteria
    * TICCL-unk:
      a cleanup tool for word frequency lists. creates a 'clean' file with desirable words, an 'unk' file with uncorrectable words and a 'punct' file with words that would be clean after removing puncuation.
    * TICCL-lexstat:
      convert an 'alphabet' file (from TICCL-anahash) into a frequency list of hashes and optionally a list of confusions.
