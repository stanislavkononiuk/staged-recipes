  summary: Efficient tree manipulations for large phylogenies, including pruning, rerooting,
    calculation of most-recent common ancestors, calculating distances from the tree
    root and calculating pairwise distances. Calculation of phylogenetic signal and
    mean trait depth (trait conservatism), ancestral state reconstruction and hidden
    character prediction of discrete characters. Simulating and fitting models of trait
    evolution, and generating random trees using birth-death models. Dating trees, comparing
    two trees, and reading/writing trees to a file. Citation
