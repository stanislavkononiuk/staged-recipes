  home: https://cran.r-project.org/package=hash
  license: GPL (>= 2)
  summary: This package implements a data structure similar to hashes in Perl and dictionaries
    in Python but with a purposefully R flavor.  For objects of appreciable size, access
    using hashes outperforms native named lists and vectors.
