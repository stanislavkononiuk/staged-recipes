  description: |
    Captum is a model interpretability and understanding library for PyTorch. 
    Captum means comprehension in Latin and contains general purpose 
    implementations of integrated gradients, saliency maps, smoothgrad, 
    vargrad and others for PyTorch models. It has quick integration for models 
    built with domain-specific libraries such as torchvision, torchtext, and others.

    *Captum is currently in beta and under active development!*
