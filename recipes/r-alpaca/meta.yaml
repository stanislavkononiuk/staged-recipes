  summary: Provides a routine to partial out factors with many levels during the optimization
    of the log-likelihood function of the corresponding generalized linear model (glm).
    The package is based on the algorithm described in Stammann (2018) <arXiv:1707.01815>
    and is restricted to glm's that are based on maximum likelihood estimation and nonlinear.
    It also offers an efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects
    in a post-estimation routine and includes robust and multi-way clustered standard
    errors. Further the package provides analytical bias corrections for binary choice
    models derived by Fernandez-Val and Weidner (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.12.014>
    and Hinz, Stammann, and Wanner (2020) <arXiv:2004.12655>.
