  summary: 'libseccomp provides an easy to use, platform independent, interface to the Linux syscall filtering mechanism.'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
    The libseccomp library provides an easy to use, platform independent, 
    interface to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism. The 
    libseccomp API is designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based 
    syscall filter language and present a more conventional function-call
    based filtering interface that should be familiar to, and easily 
    adopted by, application developers.
