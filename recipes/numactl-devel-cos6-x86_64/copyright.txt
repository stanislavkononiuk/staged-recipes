numademo links with a library derived from the C version of STREAM
by John D. McCalpin and Joe R. Zagar for one sub benchmark. See stream_lib.c 
for the license. In particular when you publish numademo output
you might need to pay attention there or filter out the STREAM results.

It also uses a public domain Mersenne Twister implementation from
Michael Brundage.
