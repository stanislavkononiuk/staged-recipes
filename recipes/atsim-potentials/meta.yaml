  summary: 'Tools and python module to assist in tabulation of pair and EAM potentials for atomistic simulation.'
  description: |
    Classical simulation codes typically contain a good selection of
    analytical forms for describing atomic interactions. Sometimes
    however, you may need to use a potential that is not directly
    supported by the code. Luckily, most simulation codes allow you to
    provide tabulated potentials in which energies and forces, for a
    range of interatomic separations, are pre-calculated and specified as
    rows within a text file. The atsim.potentials package provides python
    modules to make the specification and tabulation of pair- and
    many-body potentials straightforward and consistent.
