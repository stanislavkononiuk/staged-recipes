  summary: 'Utilities to retry Python callables.'

  description: |
    Redo provides various means to add seamless ability to retry to any Python callable.
    Redo includes a plain function (redo.retry), a decorator (redo.retriable), and a
    context manager (redo.retrying) to enable you to integrate it in the best possible
    way for your project. As a bonus, a standalone interface is also included ("retry").
