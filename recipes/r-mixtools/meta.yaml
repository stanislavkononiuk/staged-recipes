  summary: Analyzes finite mixture models for various parametric and semiparametric settings.  This
    includes mixtures of parametric distributions (normal, multivariate normal, multinomial,
    gamma), various Reliability Mixture Models (RMMs), mixtures-of-regressions settings
    (linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression, linear regression with
    changepoints, predictor-dependent mixing proportions, random effects regressions,
    hierarchical mixtures-of-experts), and tools for selecting the number of components
    (bootstrapping the likelihood ratio test statistic and model selection criteria).  Bayesian
    estimation of mixtures-of-linear-regressions models is available as well as a novel
    data depth method for obtaining credible bands.  This package is based upon work
    supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. SES-0518772.
