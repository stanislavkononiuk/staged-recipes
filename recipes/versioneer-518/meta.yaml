  description: >
    This is a tool for managing a recorded version number in setuptools-based
    python projects. The goal is to remove the tedious and error-prone "update
    the embedded version string" step from your release process. Making a new
    release should be as easy as recording a new tag in your version-control
    system, and maybe making new tarballs.
