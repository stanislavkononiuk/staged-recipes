  summary: 'A Python library for doing bibliometric and network analysis in science and health policy research'

  description: |
    metaknowledge is a Python3 library that simplifies bibliometric research using data 
    from various sources. It reads a directory of plain text files containing meta-data 
    on publications and citations, and writes to a variety of data structures that are 
    suitable for quantitative, network, and text analyses. It handles large datasets 
    (e.g. several million records) efficiently.
