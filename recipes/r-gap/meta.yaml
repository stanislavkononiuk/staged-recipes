  summary: It is designed as an integrated package for genetic data analysis of both population
    and family data. Currently, it contains functions for sample size calculations of
    both population-based and family-based designs, probability of familial disease
    aggregation, kinship calculation, statistics in linkage analysis, and association
    analysis involving genetic markers including haplotype analysis with or without
    environmental covariates.
