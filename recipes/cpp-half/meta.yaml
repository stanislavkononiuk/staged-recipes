  summary: Half-precision floating-point library
  description: |
    This is a C++ header-only library to provide an IEEE 754 conformant 16-bit
    half-precision floating-point type along with corresponding arithmetic
    operators, type conversions and common mathematical functions. It aims for
    both efficiency and ease of use, trying to accurately mimic the behaviour
    of the built-in floating-point types at the best performance possible.
