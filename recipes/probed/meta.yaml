  description: |
    Probed is a library that exposes three classes: ProbedDict,
     ProbedList and ProbedSet. These classes are containers like the
     built-in Python containers (dict, list, set) which they subclass
     with the added functionality in which the user is notified when the
     data content of collection changes, and the ability to put a probe
     into data collection to do more than just be notified.
