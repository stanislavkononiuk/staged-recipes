  summary: 'A little Python script to collect LaTeX sources for upload to the arXiv'
  description: |
    A small script to collect your LaTeX files for submission to the arXiv. Main features:

    - By default, strips potentially-embarrassing comments from your uploaded
      `.tex` files.
    - Includes the necessary parts of any system package you tell it to upload.
      By default, this includes biblatex (if you use it) to avoid errors like
      `Package biblatex Warning: File '.bbl' is wrong format version`.
    - Only uploads things you actually use: if you have an image you're not
      including anymore or whatever, doesn't upload it.
