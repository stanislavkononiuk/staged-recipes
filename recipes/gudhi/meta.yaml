  summary: Geometry Understanding in Higher Dimensions
  description: |
    The GUDHI library is a generic open source C++ library, with a Python
    interface, for Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Higher Dimensional
    Geometry Understanding. The library offers state-of-the-art data structures
    and algorithms to construct simplicial complexes and compute persistent
    homology.
