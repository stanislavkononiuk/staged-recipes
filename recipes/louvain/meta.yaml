  summary: "Implementation of the Louvain algorithm for various methods for use with igraph in python."
  description: |
    This package implements the louvain algorithm in C++ and
    exposes it to python. It relies on (python-)igraph for it to
    function. Besides the relative flexibility of the
    implementation, it also scales well, and can be run on graphs
    of millions of nodes (as long as they can fit in memory).
    The core function is find_partition which finds the optimal
    partition using the louvain algorithm for a number of
    different methods.
