  summary: 'RADICAL-Pilot (RP) is a Pilot Job system written in Python'
  description: |
    RADICAL-Pilot is a flexible Pilot System that provides a simple and scalable 
    approach for executing many concurrent simulations and their data requirements 
    on clusters, grids, and clouds. RADICAL-Pilot is written in Python, and as such 
    is easily deployable into user space. It allows user-level control of Pilots 
    and supports a wide range of application types.
