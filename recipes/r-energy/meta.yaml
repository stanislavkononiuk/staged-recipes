  summary: E-statistics (energy) tests and statistics for multivariate and univariate inference,
    including distance correlation, one-sample, two-sample, and multi-sample tests for
    comparing multivariate distributions, are implemented. Measuring and testing multivariate
    independence based on distance correlation, partial distance correlation, multivariate
    goodness-of-fit tests, clustering based on energy distance, testing for multivariate
    normality, distance components (disco) for non-parametric analysis of structured
    data, and other energy statistics/methods are implemented.
