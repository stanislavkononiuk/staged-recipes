  summary: An interface to the Apache OpenNLP tools (version 1.5.3). The Apache OpenNLP library
    is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text
    written in Java. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence
    segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing,
    and coreference resolution. See <https://opennlp.apache.org/> for more information.
