  description: |
    Inspired by Google's zx, but made much simpler and more accessible using
     Python. While Bash is cool, and it's extremely powerful when paired with
     linux coreutils and pipes. But apart from that, it's a whole another
     language to learn, and has a (comparatively) unintuitive syntax for things
     like conditionals and loops. zxpy aims to supercharge bash by allowing you
     to write scripts in Python, but with native support for bash commands and
     pipes.
