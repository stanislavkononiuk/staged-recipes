  summary: Surface Volume Meshing Toolkit (SVMTK)
  description: |
    Surface Volume Meshing Toolkit (SVMTK) is a Python frontend
    for specific 2D and 3D mesh generation methods in the
    Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL).

    SVMTK was designed to create volume meshes of soft organic tissue surfaces,
    like the human brain, with the option to repair unphysical errors on the surfaces.
