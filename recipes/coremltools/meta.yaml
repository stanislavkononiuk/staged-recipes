  description: |
    Core ML is an Apple framework to integrate machine learning models into your app.

    Use the coremltools Python package to convert models from third-party training libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch to the Core ML format. You can then use Core ML to integrate the models into your app.

    Core ML provides a unified representation for all models. Your app uses Core ML APIs and user data to make predictions, and to fine-tune models, all on the user’s device. Running a model strictly on the user’s device removes any need for a network connection, which helps keep the user’s data private and your app responsive.

    Core ML optimizes on-device performance by leveraging the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine while minimizing its memory footprint and power consumption.
