  description: |
    PySurfer is a Python library for visualizing cortical surface
    representations of neuroimaging data. The package is primarily intended for
    use with Freesurfer, but it can plot data that are drawn from a variety of
    sources. PySurfer extends Mayaviâ€™s powerful rendering engine with a
    high-level interface for working with MRI and MEG data.
