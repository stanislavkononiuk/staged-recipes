build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"

requirements:
  build:
    # If your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add the required compilers as separate entries here.
    # Compilers are named 'c', 'cxx' and 'fortran'.
    - {{ compiler('c') }}
  host:
    - python
    - pip
    - numpy
  run:
    - python
    - astropy

    - beautifulsoup4
    - six

test:
  # Some packages might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.
  imports:
    - pysynphot
  # For python packages, it is useful to run pip check. However, sometimes the
  # metadata used by pip is out of date. Thus this section is optional if it is
  # failing.
