  summary: 'Arrays of numbers for Python, optimized for small sizes'
  description: |
    Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small sizes. 
    Common operations on very small arrays are to 3-7 times faster than 
    with NumPy (with NumPy 1.6 it used to be up to 35 times), and 3 times 
    less memory is used to store them. Tinyarrays are useful if you need 
    many small arrays of numbers, and cannot combine them into a few 
    large ones. (The resulting code is still much slower than C, but it 
    may now be fast enough.)
