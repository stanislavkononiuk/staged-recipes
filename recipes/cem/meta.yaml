  summary: Coastline evolution model
  description: |
    The Coastline Evolution Model (CEM) addresses predominately sandy,
    wave-dominated coastlines on time-scales ranging from years to
    millenia and on spatial scales ranging from kilometers to hundreds
    of kilometers. Shoreline evolution results from gradients in
    wave-driven alongshore sediment transport. At its most basic level,
    the model follows the standard 'one-line' modeling approach, where
    the cross-shore dimension is collapsed into a single data point.
    However, the model allows the plan-view shoreline to take on arbitrary
    local orientations, and even fold back upon itself, as complex shapes
    such as capes and spits form under some wave climates (distributions
    of wave influences from different approach angles). The model can
    also represent the geology underlying the sandy coastline and
    shoreface in a simplified manner and enables the simulation of
    coastline evolution when sediment supply from an eroding shoreface
    may be constrained. CEM also supports the simulation of human
    manipulations to coastline evolution through beach nourishment or
    hard structures.
