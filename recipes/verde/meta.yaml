  summary: "Processing and gridding spatial data using Green's functions"
  description: |
    Verde is a Python library for processing spatial data (bathymetry, geophysics
    surveys, etc) and interpolating it on regular grids (i.e., *gridding*).
    Most gridding methods in Verde use a Green's functions approach.
    A linear model is estimated based on the input data and then used to predict
    data on a regular grid (or in a scatter, a profile, as derivatives).
    The models are Green's functions from (mostly) elastic deformation theory.
    This approach is very similar to *machine learning* so we implement gridder
    classes that are similar to `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`__
    regression classes.
    The API is not 100% compatible but it should look familiar to those with some
    scikit-learn experience.
