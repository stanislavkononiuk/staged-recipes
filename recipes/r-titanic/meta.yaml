  summary: This data set provides information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage
    of the ocean liner "Titanic", summarized according to economic status (class), sex,
    age and survival. Whereas the base R Titanic data found by calling data("Titanic")
    is an array resulting from cross-tabulating 2201 observations, these data sets are
    the individual non-aggregated observations and formatted in a machine learning context
    with a training sample, a testing sample, and two additional data sets that can
    be used for deeper machine learning analysis. These data sets are also the data
    sets downloaded from the Kaggle competition and thus lowers the barrier to entry
    for users new to R or machine learing.
