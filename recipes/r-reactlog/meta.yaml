  summary: Building interactive web applications with R is incredibly easy with 'shiny'. Behind
    the scenes, 'shiny' builds a reactive graph that can quickly become intertwined
    and difficult to debug. 'reactlog'  (Schloerke 2019) <doi:10.5281/zenodo.2591517>
    provides a visual insight into that black box of 'shiny' reactivity by constructing
    a directed dependency graph of the application's reactive state at any time point
    in a reactive recording.
