  summary: 'Colordiff is a wrapper for diff and produces the same output but with pretty syntax highlighting.'
  description: |
    Colordiff is a wrapper for diff and produces the same output as diff but
    with coloured syntax highlighting at the command line to improve
    readability. The output is similar to how a diff-generated patch might
    appear in Vim or Emacs with the appropriate syntax highlighting options
    enabled.
