  summary: R's 'sf' package ships with self-contained 'GDAL' executables, including a bare bones
    interface to several 'GDAL'-related utility programs collectively known as the 'GDAL
    utilities'. For each of those utilities, this package provides an R wrapper whose
    formal arguments closely mirror those of the 'GDAL' command line interface. The
    utilities operate on data stored in files and typically write their output to other
    files. Therefore, to process data stored in any of R's more common spatial formats
    (i.e. those supported by the 'sp', 'sf', and 'raster' packages), first write them
    to disk, then process them with the package's wrapper functions before reading the
    outputted results back into R. GDAL function arguments introduced in GDAL version
    3.2.1 or earlier are supported.
