  summary: Small tool for deferring actions and operations on objects and classes
  license: MIT

  description: |
    Mimic is a tool with the intention to defer actions done on objects or
     classes. These actions can then be executed at a later date. It's main
     goal is to solve the chicken-and-egg design conundrum, likely attributed to
     a sub-optimal project design. Sometimes, though, when working with 3rd
     party libraries, you just don't have the choice, and the design of one
     library does not mesh with that of another. This library gives control over
     "when" the user initialized "what", while being able to do it in a
      controlled local scope without losing the ability to use global
      definitions.
