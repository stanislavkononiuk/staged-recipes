  summary: 'There are some things that I wish were easier with the ''stringr''  or ''stringi''
    packages. The foremost of these is the extraction of numbers  from strings. ''stringr''
    and ''stringi'' make you figure out the regular  expression for yourself; ''strex''
    takes care of this for you. There are many  other handy functionalities in ''strex''.
    Contributions to this package are  encouraged: it is intended as a miscellany of
    string manipulation functions  that cannot be found in ''stringi'' or ''stringr''.'
