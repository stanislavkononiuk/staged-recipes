  summary: Construct and plot objective hierarchies and associated value and utility functions.
    Evaluate the values and utilities and visualize the results as colored objective
    hierarchies or tables. Visualize uncertainty by plotting median and quantile intervals
    within the nodes of objective hierarchies. Get numerical results of the evaluations
    in standard R data types for further processing.
