  summary: Provides an up-to-date copy of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Time
    Zone Database. It is updated periodically to reflect changes made by political bodies
    to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets, and daylight saving time rules. Additionally,
    this package provides a C++ interface for working with the 'date' library. 'date'
    provides comprehensive support for working with dates and date-times, which this
    package exposes to make it easier for other R packages to utilize. Headers are provided
    for calendar specific calculations, along with a limited interface for time zone
    manipulations.
