  summary: 'DAE Tools: equation-based object-oriented modelling, simulation and optimisation software'
  description: |
    DAE Tools is a cross-platform equation-based object-oriented modelling, simulation and optimisation software. It is not a modelling language nor a collection of numerical libraries but rather a higher level structure â€“ an architectural design of interdependent software components providing an API for 
    - Model development/specification
    - Activities on developed models, such as simulation, optimisation, sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation
    - Processing of the results, such as plotting and exporting to various file formats
    - Report generation
    - Code generation, co-simulation and model exchange
