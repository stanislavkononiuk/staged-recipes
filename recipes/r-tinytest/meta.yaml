  summary: 'Provides a lightweight (zero-dependency) and easy to use unit testing framework.
    Main features: install tests with the package. Test results are treated as data
    that can be stored and manipulated. Test files are R scripts interspersed with test
    commands, that can be programmed over. Fully automated build-install-test sequence
    for packages. Skip tests when not run locally (e.g. on CRAN). Flexible and configurable
    output printing. Compare computed output with output stored with the package. Run
    tests in parallel. Extensible by other packages. Report side effects.'
