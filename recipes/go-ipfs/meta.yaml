  summary: 'IPFS implementation in Go'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines good ideas
    from previous systems such as Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web.
    It is like a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides
    an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built-in. You
    can also mount the world at /ipfs.
