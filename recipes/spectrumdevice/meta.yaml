  summary: A high-level, object-oriented Python library for controlling Spectrum Instrumentation digitisers
  description: |
    spectrumdevice is a high-level, object-oriented Python library for controlling Spectrum Instrumentation digitisers.
    It can connect to individual digitisers or StarHubs (e.g. the NetBox). The main module spectrumdevice provides
    two classes SpectrumCard and SpectrumStarHub for controlling and receiving data from individual digitisers and
    StarHubs respectively. Mock classes are also provided for testing software without drivers installed or hardware
    connected.The submodule spectrumdevice.settings provides Enums and Dataclasses wrapping the register values
    provided by the Spectrum API, to be used for configuring hardware and interpreting responses received from hardware.
