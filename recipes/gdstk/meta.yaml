  summary: 'Gdstk (GDSII Tool Kit) is a C++ library for creation and manipulation of GDSII stream files.'

  description: |
    Gdstk (GDSII Tool Kit) is a C++ library for creation and manipulation of
    GDSII stream files. It is also available as a Python module meant to be a
    successor to Gdspy.  Key features for the creation of complex CAD layouts
    are included: 1. Boolean operations on polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) based
    on clipping algorithm; 2. Polygon offset (inward and outward rescaling of
    polygons); and 3. Efficient point-in-polygon solutions for large array
    sets.
