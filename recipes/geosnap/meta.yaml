  description: |
    geosnap is an open-source, Python3 package for exploring, modeling, and visualizing neighborhood 
    dynamics. It provides a suite of tools for creating socio-spatial datasets, harmonizing those 
    datasets into consistent set of time-static boundaries, and modeling neighborhood change using 
    classic and spatial statistical methods.
