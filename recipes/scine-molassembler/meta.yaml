  summary: |
    Chemoinformatics toolkit with support for inorganic molecules
  description: |
    Molassembler is a C++ library that aims to facilitate conversions between
    Cartesian and graph representations of molecules. It provides the necessary
    functionality to represent a molecule as a graph, modify it in graph space,
    and generate new coordinates from graphs. It can capture the absolute configuration
    of inorganic molecules with multidentate and haptic ligands from Cartesian
    coordinates and enumerate non-superposable stereopermutations at non-terminal
    atoms and non-isotropic bonds at arbitrary local shapes ranging up to the
    icosahedron and cuboctahedron.
