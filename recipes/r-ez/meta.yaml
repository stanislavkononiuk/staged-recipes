  summary: Facilitates easy analysis of factorial experiments, including purely within-Ss designs
    (a.k.a. "repeated measures"), purely between-Ss designs, and mixed within-and-between-Ss
    designs. The functions in this package aim to provide simple, intuitive and consistent
    specification of data analysis and visualization. Visualization functions also include
    design visualization for pre-analysis data auditing, and correlation matrix visualization.
    Finally, this package includes functions for non-parametric analysis, including
    permutation tests and bootstrap resampling. The bootstrap function obtains predictions
    either by cell means or by more advanced/powerful mixed effects models, yielding
    predictions and confidence intervals that may be easily visualized at any level
    of the experiment's design.
