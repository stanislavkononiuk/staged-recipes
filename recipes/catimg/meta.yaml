  summary: 'Print an image of a cat from Imgur to iTerm2.'

  description: |
    Print an image of a cat from Imgur to iTerm2.

    Uses iTerm2's proprietary escape codes and Imgur to display an image of a
    cat in your terminal.

    NOTE: I do not own the images that you see, nor have I any control over
    them. You will see some image that is tagged as "cat" on Imgur. That could
    be anything. I do filter out images that are tagged NSFW, but there are no
    guarantees that you won't see something you wish you hadn't. Use at your
    own risk.

    SECOND NOTE: This requires iTerm2 2.9 or later. You can download it at
    https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html.
