  summary: 'A Python API for working with Neurodata stored in the NWB Format'
  description: |
    Neurophysiology (NWB:N) is a project to develop a unified data format for
    cellular-based neurophysiology data, focused on the dynamics of groups of
    neurons measured under a large range of experimental conditions.
    The NWB:N team consists of neuroscientists and software developers
    who recognize that adoption of a unified data format is an important
    step toward breaking down the barriers to data sharing in neuroscience.
