  summary: "Measure of the Effect ('MOTE') is an effect size calculator, including a wide variety
    of effect sizes in the mean differences family (all versions of d) and the variance
    overlap family (eta, omega, epsilon, r). 'MOTE' provides non-central confidence
    intervals for each effect size, relevant test statistics, and output for reporting
    in APA Style (American Psychological Association, 2010, <ISBN:1433805618>) with
    'LaTeX'. In research, an over-reliance on p-values may conceal the fact that a study
    is under-powered (Halsey, Curran-Everett, Vowler, & Drummond, 2015 <doi:10.1038/nmeth.3288>).
    A test may be statistically significant, yet practically inconsequential (Fritz,
    Scherndl, & K\xFChberger, 2012 <doi:10.1177/0959354312436870>). Although the American
    Psychological Association has long advocated for the inclusion of effect sizes (Wilkinson
    & American Psychological Association Task Force on Statistical Inference, 1999 <doi:10.1037/0003-066X.54.8.594>),
    the vast majority of peer-reviewed, published academic studies stop short of reporting
    effect sizes and confidence intervals (Cumming, 2013, <doi:10.1177/0956797613504966>).
    'MOTE' simplifies the use and interpretation of effect sizes and confidence intervals.
