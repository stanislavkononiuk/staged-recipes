  summary: A fast dimensionality reduction method scaleable to large numbers of samples. Landmark
    Multi-Dimensional Scaling (LMDS) is an extension of classical Torgerson MDS, but
    rather than calculating a complete distance matrix between all pairs of samples,
    only the distances between a set of landmarks and the samples are calculated.
