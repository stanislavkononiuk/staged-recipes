build:

  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe
  # is exactly the same for all platforms. It is okay if the dependencies are
  # not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not
  # allowed. See
  # https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python
  # for more details.

  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use
  # separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key. By default, the
  # package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and
  # for all major OSs. Add the line "skip: True # [py<35]" (for example) to
  # limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True # [not win]" to limit to
  # Windows.
