  summary: Framework for visualising tables of counts, proportions and probabilities. The framework
    is called product plots, alluding to the computation of area as a product of height
    and width, and the statistical concept of generating a joint distribution from the
    product of conditional and marginal distributions. The framework, with extensions,
    is sufficient to encompass over 20 visualisations previously described in fields
    of statistical graphics and 'infovis', including bar charts, mosaic plots, 'treemaps',
    equal area plots and fluctuation diagrams.
