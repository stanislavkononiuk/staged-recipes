  summary: 'The Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK", pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit'

  description: |
    FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
    UNIX/Linux (X11), Microsoft Windows, and MacOS X. FLTK provides
    modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via
    OpenGL and its built-in GLUT emulation.

    FLTK is designed to be small and modular enough to be statically
    linked, but works fine as a shared library. FLTK also includes an
    excellent UI builder called FLUID that can be used to create
    applications in minutes.
