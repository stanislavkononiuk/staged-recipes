  summary: 'Merge paired sequencing reads into single longer sequences'
  description: |
    FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) is a very fast
    and accurate software tool to merge paired-end reads from
    next-generation sequencing experiments. FLASH is designed to
    merge pairs of reads when the original DNA fragments are
    shorter than twice the length of reads. The resulting longer
    reads can significantly improve genome assemblies. They can
    also improve transcriptome assembly when FLASH is used to
    merge RNA-seq data.
