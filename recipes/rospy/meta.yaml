  description: |
    rospy is a pure Python client library for ROS. The rospy client API enables
    Python programmers to quickly interface with ROS Topics, Services, and
    Parameters. The design of rospy favors implementation speed (i.e. developer
    time) over runtime performance so that algorithms can be quickly prototyped
    and tested within ROS. It is also ideal for non-critical-path code, such as
    configuration and initialization code. Many of the ROS tools are written in
    rospy to take advantage of the type introspection capabilities. Many of the
    ROS tools, such as rostopic and rosservice, are built on top of rospy.
