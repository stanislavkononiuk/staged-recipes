  summary: 'A machine learning environment for atomic-scale modeling in surface science and catalysis.'

  description: |
    Utilities for building and testing atomic machine learning models. 
    Gaussian Processes (GP) regression machine learning routines are 
    implemented. These will take any numpy array of training and test 
    feature matrices along with a vector of target values.
    In general, any data prepared in this fashion can be fed to the 
    GP routines, a number of additional functions have been added that 
    interface with ASE. This integration allows for the manipulation of 
    atoms objects through GP predictions, as well as dynamic generation 
    of descriptors through use of the many ASE functions.
