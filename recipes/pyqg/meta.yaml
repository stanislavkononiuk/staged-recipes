  summary: 'Python quasigeostrophic model'
  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    Pyqg is a python solver for quasigeostrophic systems. Quasigeostophic
    equations are an approximation to the full fluid equations of motion in
    the limit of strong rotation and stratitifcation and are most applicable
    to geophysical fluid dynamics problems.
