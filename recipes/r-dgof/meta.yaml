  summary: This package contains a proposed revision to the stats::ks.test() function and the
    associated ks.test.Rd help page.  With one minor exception, it does not change the
    existing behavior of ks.test(), and it adds features necessary for doing one-sample
    tests with hypothesized discrete distributions.  The package also contains cvm.test(),
    for doing one-sample Cramer-von Mises goodness-of-fit tests.
