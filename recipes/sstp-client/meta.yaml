  summary: "SSTP (Microsofts Remote Access Solution for PPP over SSL) client"

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
      SSTP is Microsofts Remote Access Solution (RAS) for PPP over SSL. It can
      be used instead of PPTP or L2TP, and is only available with Windows
      Vista/7 connecting to a Windows 2008 Server. The advantage of SSTP
      compared to PPTP and L2TP is that it cannot be easily blocked by
      firewalls since the traffic is transmitted over HTTPS on port 443.
      Windows Vista/7 uses SSTP if PPTP or L2TP cannot be established. For
      further information on SSTP check out wikipedia's article on Secure
      Socket Tunneling Protocol.
