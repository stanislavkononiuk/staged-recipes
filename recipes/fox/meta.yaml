  summary: 'A Fortran library for XML'

  description: |
    FoX is an XML library written in Fortran 95. It allows software 
    developers to read, write and modify XML documents from Fortran 
    applications without the complications of dealing with 
    multi-language development. FoX can be freely redistributed as 
    part of open source and commercial software packages.
