  summary: Pimp your Class/Property/Methods with useful functionality

  description: |
    This library provides base classes to enable useful behavior in
    Python Objects. The central purpose of the library is to extend
    python properties to allow: get/set logging; get/set timing, success
    and failure stats; async locking; get/set coercion and conversion;
    value cache; prevent unnecessary set; and read once properties. But
    most importantly, it allows owner specific configurations. The
    library also provides DictProperties: that is properties that can be
    accessed by key; and also methods!
