  description: |
    In order to develop Neural Network potential-energy surfaces for a 
    variety of system, we have developed our in-house NN code for 
    high-dimensional systems called RuNNer, which was the first 
    implementation of high-dimensional NN potentials. Much of the 
    methodology has been originally developed with this code.
