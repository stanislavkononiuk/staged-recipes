  summary: 'Eight is a Python module that provides a minimalist compatibility layer between Python 3 and 2'
  description: |
    Eight is inspired by six, nine, and python-future, but provides better
    internationalization (i18n) support, is more lightweight, easier to use,
    and unambiguously biased toward Python 3 code: if you remove eight from
    your code, it will continue to function exactly as it did with eight on
    Python 3.
