  summary: 'DCW-GMT - The Digital Chart of the World for GMT 5'

  description: |
    The Digital Chart of the World (DCW) is a comprehensive
    1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. The charts were
    designed to meet the needs of pilots and air crews in medium-and
    low-altitude en route navigation and to support military
    operational planning, intelligence briefings, and other
    needs. This is the version of DCW used by Generic Mapping Tools.
