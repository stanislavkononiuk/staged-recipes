  summary: Tools for observing the terrestrial and aquatic surfaces of Earth
  description: "# Observatory\n[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/Freshwater-Initiative/Observatory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Freshwater-Initiative/Observatory)\n\nTools for observing\
    \ the terrestrial and aquatic surfaces of Earth \n\n\"You belong among the wildflowers, you belong somewhere you feel free.\" Tom Petty\n\nAn observatory is a location used for observing terrestrial\
    \ or celestial events (thank you Wikipedia). Observatories have been as simple as containing an astronomical sextant, and as complicated as modern academic supported observatories containing multi-million\
    \ dollar instruments, tools, with institutions supporting long term research and education programs.  While observatories are usually thought of as star-gazing investments in the field of astronomy,\
    \ observatories have also been constructed in climatology/meteorology, geophysical, oceanography and volcanology communities, in order to investigate and coordinate their research efforts.  \n\nThis\
    \ repository is intended for the sharing and distribution of open-source Python based code useful for model and data integration that improves access to large datasets, reduces computational burden,\
    \ reinvent the wheel less often, and share and communicate more about how to synthesize earth surface observations in useful ways.\n\n## Installing Latest Master Version\n\nLinux/OSX:\n\n```bash\nwget\
    \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Freshwater-Initiative/Observatory/master/requirements.txt\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Freshwater-Initiative/Observatory/master/requirements-dev.txt\n\
    conda create -n oghenv -c conda-forge python=2.7 --file requirements.txt --file requirements-dev.txt\nsource activate oghenv\npip install git+https://github.com/Freshwater-Initiative/Observatory.git\n\
    ```\n\n# Work with a git-versioned-folder in hydroshare to develop your own Utilities\n0) Make a fork of Freshwater-Initiative/Observatory\n1) In HydroShare, get to JupyterHub and open up a terminal\
    \ instance.\n2) Change the working directory to notebooks/utilities\n## If you haven't cloned this repository into Hydroshare yet:\n3) type/copy in \"git clone <github link>\" that is available from\
    \ your fork (eg., https://github.com/username/Observatory.git)\n4) then type in your github username and password to then download the git clone.\n  $ git config --global user.name \"your git username\"\
    \n  $ git config --global user.email \"your email that you used to setup the git account\"\n5) you should now have notebooks/utilities/Observatory subdirectory with this README.md and the observatory_gridded_hydrometeorology.py\
    \ (OGH) within.\n## If you have previously cloned the git folder to notebooks/utilities, update this to the latest file\n3) Change the working directory to notebooks/utilities/Observatory\n4) Pull the\
    \ latest (your updated fork - pull from Freshwater-Initiative/Observatory master, before you do this) files from the repository\n  $ git pull\n5) you should now have notebooks/utilities/Observatory\
    \ subdirectory that matches your fork on github.com (which should match Freshwater-Initiative/Observatory - if you pulled from the master)\n## Either way:\n6) Change the working directory to notebooks/utilities/Observatory\n\
    7) Copy observatory_gridded_hydromet.py to notebooks/utilities/\n  $ cp observatory_gridded_hydromet.py ../\n  Now, the file '/notebooks/utilities/observatory_gridded_hydromet.py' is updated to the\
    \ latest state (from git) \n\n## Saving changes back to git repository\n\n8) Work on the file and save the changes.\n9) Change the working directory to '/notebooks/utilities'\n10) Copy the modified\
    \ file back to git versioned folder\n  $ cp 'observatory_gridded_hydromet.py' Observatory/\n11) Change the working directory to '/notebooks/utilities/Observatory'\n12) Check file changes \n  $ git status\n\
    13) Commit the changes\n  $ git add observatory_gridded_hydromet.py\n  $ git commit -m 'Add message to describe these changes, if any'\n  $ git push\n14) Check that the files changed\n  $ git status\n\
    \n \u201CUse only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it.\u201D Bruce Lee"
