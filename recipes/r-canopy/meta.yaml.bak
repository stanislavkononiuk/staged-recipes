  summary: A statistical framework and computational procedure for identifying the sub-populations
    within a tumor, determining the mutation profiles of each  subpopulation, and inferring
    the tumor's phylogenetic history. The input are  variant allele frequencies (VAFs)
    of somatic single nucleotide alterations  (SNAs) along with allele-specific coverage
    ratios between the tumor and matched normal sample for somatic copy number alterations
    (CNAs). These quantities can be directly taken from the output of existing software.
    Canopy provides a  general mathematical framework for pooling data across samples
    and sites to  infer the underlying parameters. For SNAs that fall within CNA regions,
    Canopy infers their temporal ordering and resolves their phase.  When there are  multiple
    evolutionary configurations consistent with the data, Canopy outputs  all configurations
    along with their confidence assessment.
