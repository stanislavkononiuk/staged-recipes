    # After splitting out of tensorflow, the tensorboard pypi package is problematic:
    #
    #  - tensorflow does not need tensorboard to work
    #    (but depends on it, just to avoid surprising the users that were used to have tensorboard in the package)
    #
    #  - tensorboard does need tensorflow to work
    #    (but does not depend on it explicitly to avoid cyclical dependencies)
    #
    # This means that the tensorboard package is not standalone and should always be installed
    # by installing tensorflow. At the moment we are mirroring in conda-forge the wrongs on
    # pypi.
    #
    # Also note that this makes the noarch nature of the package a bit of a wishful thinking
    # (we can use tensorboard only on platforms with a tensorflow package available).

    #  Issue in TB tracker: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/410
    #  Initial recipe PR: https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/3866
    #  Issue in the TF recipe: https://github.com/conda-forge/tensorflow-feedstock/issues/42
    #
    # An alternative solution would be to uncomment the tensorflow dependency down here
    # and remove the tensorflow dependency on the tensorboard package. Pros: this would create
    # a saner dependency cycle. Cons: it would be inconsitent with the official pypi releases.

    # - tensorflow >=1.4.0

test:
  imports:
    - tensorboard
  # To be super-strict, we should run the original tests with bazel against the newly created package
