    #
    # After splitting out of tensorflow, the tensorboard pypi package is problematic:
    #  - the tensorflow package depends on tensorboard (but does not need tensorboard for anything, it is just for backwards compatibility)
    #  - the tensorboard package does logically depend on tensorflow (but does not do implicitly to avoid cyclical dependencies)
    # In fact, the first pypi release of tensorboard had a circular dependency with tensorflow, which was nasty to us tensorboard-gpu users.
    # They fixed it in 0.1.5 (see https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/releases/tag/0.1.5) by not depending on tensorflow anymore.
    # But now the package in pypi is not anymore standalone (you need to install tensorflow for it to work, even if TF is not a explicit dep).
    #
    # In conda-land we must break that vicious cycle and use the proper dependency graph:
    #  tensorboard depends on tensorflow, tensorflow does not depend on tensorboard.
    #
    # Also note that this makes the noarch nature of the package a bit of a wishful thinking
    # (we can use tensorboard only on platforms with a tensorflow package available).
    #

    - tensorflow >=1.3.0

test:
  imports:
    - tensorboard
  # To be super-strict, we should run the original tests with bazel against the newly created package
