  summary: 'Get things from one computer to another, safely.' 

  description: |
    This package provides a library and a command-line tool named wormhole, 
    which makes it possible to get arbitrary-sized files and directories (or 
    short pieces of text) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are 
    identified by using identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending 
    machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into 
    the receiving machine.
