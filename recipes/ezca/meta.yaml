  summary: aLIGO CDS Python EPICS interface
  description: |
    Ezca is a wrapping around pyepics containing methods specially
    designed for interfacing with the Advanced LIGO CDS front-end control
    system (e.g. "RCG").  Beyond providing standard methods for reading
    and writing EPICS channels, it also includes the LIGOFilter object for
    interacting with CDS Standard Filter Modules.  It also handles
    abstracting information about the interferometer under control, and
    sub-classing specific control domains.
    It is specifically designed to be integrated into the Guardian
    automation platform, but it's also perfectly usable on it's own.
