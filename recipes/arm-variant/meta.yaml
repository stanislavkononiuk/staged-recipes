  summary: 'A meta-package to select the ARM variant.'
  description: |
    There are a couple of ARM variants that differ based on architecture.

    Currently the main ones are:
      * SBSA ( Server Base System Architecture ), which is used in clusters, cloud environments, etc.
      * Tegra ( System on a Chip ), which is used in edge applications like mobile internet devices, streaming systems, etc.

    Mainly these differ as they have 2 different `cudatoolkit`s. So this package is used to select between them.

    The default is SBSA. So Tegra users should make sure to change this if needed.
