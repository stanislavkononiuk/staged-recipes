  summary: Square pie charts (a.k.a. waffle charts) can be used to communicate parts of a whole
    for categorical quantities. To emulate the percentage view of a pie chart, a 10x10
    grid should be used with each square representing 1% of the total. Modern uses of
    waffle charts do not necessarily adhere to this rule and can be created with a grid
    of any rectangular shape. Best practices suggest keeping the number of categories
    small, just as should be done when creating pie charts. Tools are provided to create
    waffle charts as well as stitch them together, and to use glyphs for making isotype
    pictograms.
