  summary: Implementation of algorithms for cutting numerical values exhibiting a potentially
    highly skewed distribution into evenly distributed groups (bins). This functionality
    can be applied for binning discrete values, such as counts, as well as for discretization
    of continuous values, for example, during generation of features used in machine
    learning algorithms.
