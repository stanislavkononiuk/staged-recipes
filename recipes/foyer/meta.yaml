  summary: 'Atom-typing and force field dissemination.'
  description: |
    Foyer is an open-source Python tool that enables users to define and apply
    force field atom-typing rules in a format that is both human- and
    machine-readable and provides a framework for force field dissemination,
    thus eliminating ambiguity in atom-typing and improving reproducibility.
    Foyer defines force fields in an XML format, where SMARTS strings are used
    to define the chemical context of a particular atom type and "overrides"
    are used to set rule precedence, rather than a rigid hierarchical scheme.
