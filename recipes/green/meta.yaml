  summary: 'Green is a clean, colorful, fast python test runner'
  description: >
    Green - A clean, colorful, fast python test runner.

    Features
    --------

    - **Clean** - Low redundancy in output. Result statistics for each test is vertically aligned.
    - **Colorful** - Terminal output makes good use of color when the terminal supports it.
    - **Fast** - Tests run in independent processes.  (One per processor by default.  Does *not* play nicely with `gevent`)
    - **Powerful** - Multi-target + auto-discovery.
    - **Traditional** - Use the normal `unittest` classes and methods for your unit tests.
    - **Descriptive** - Multiple verbosity levels, from just dots to full docstring output.
    - **Convenient** - Bash-completion and ZSH-completion of options and test targets.
    - **Thorough** - Built-in, optional integration with
      [coverage](http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/).
    - **Embedded** - Can be run with a setup command without in-site installation.
    - **Modern** - Supports Python 2.7, and 3.4+. Additionally, [PyPy](http://pypy.org) is supported on a best-effort basis.
    - **Portable** - macOS, Linux, and BSDs are fully supported.  Windows is supported on a best-effort basis.
    - **Living** - This project grows and changes.  See the
