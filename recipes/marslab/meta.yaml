  summary: Utilities for working with observational data of Mars.
  description: marslab is the core support library for the marslab ecosystem (https://github.com/MillionConcepts/marslab-reference). It defines common formats, shared references, and support objects, many of which are also useful on their own. Highlights include Look, a lightweight construction kit for multispectral visualizations; and BandSet, an object that streamlines operations on multispectral observations, treating entire clusters of related images as coherent wholes.
