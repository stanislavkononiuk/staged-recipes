  license: BSD_3_clause
  summary: Provides interface to 'sparsepp' - fast, memory efficient hash map.  It is derived
    from Google's excellent 'sparsehash' implementation. We believe 'sparsepp' provides
    an unparalleled combination of performance and memory usage,  and will outperform
    your compiler's unordered_map on both counts.  Only Google's 'dense_hash_map' is
    consistently faster, at the cost of much greater  memory usage (especially when
    the final size of the map is not known in advance).
