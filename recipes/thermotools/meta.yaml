  summary: 'Lowlevel implementation of (transition-based and histogram) reweighting analyis methods for Python.'

  description: |
    The thermotools package is a lowlevel implementation toolbox for the analyis
    of multi-ensemble calculations. It contains estimators for the state-continuous transition-based
    reweighting analysis method (TRAM) and its state-discrete variant (dTRAM), Bennet acceptance ratio
    (BAR) and its multi-state variant (MBAR), and the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM).
    While you can use thermotools on its own, we recommend to use it in combination with PyEMMA.
