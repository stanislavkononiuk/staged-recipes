  summary: There are two functions-meta2d and meta3d for detecting rhythmic signals from time-series
    datasets. For analyzing time-series datasets without individual information, 'meta2d'
    is  suggested, which could incorporates multiple methods from ARSER,  JTK_CYCLE
    and Lomb-Scargle in the detection of interested rhythms. For  analyzing time-series
    datasets with individual information, 'meta3d' is  suggested, which takes use of
    any one of these three methods to analyze  time-series data individual by individual
    and gives out integrated values  based on analysis result of each individual.
