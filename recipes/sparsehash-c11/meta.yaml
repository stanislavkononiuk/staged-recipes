  summary: 'Experimental C++11 version of sparsehash'
  description: |
    This header-only package contains several hash-map implementations,
    similar in API to SGI's hash_map class, but with different performance
    characteristics.  sparse_hash_map uses very little space overhead, 1-2
    bits per entry.  dense_hash_map is very fast, particulary on lookup.
    (sparse_hash_set and dense_hash_set are the set versions of these
    routines.)  On the other hand, these classes have requirements that
    may not make them appropriate for all applications.
