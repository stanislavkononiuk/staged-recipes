  summary: A general-purpose computational engine for data analysis, drake rebuilds intermediate
    data objects when their dependencies change, and it skips work when the results
    are already up to date. Not every execution starts from scratch, there is native
    support for parallel and distributed computing, and completed projects have tangible
    evidence that they are reproducible. Extensive documentation, from beginner-friendly
    tutorials to practical examples and more, is available at the reference website
    <https://ropensci.github.io/drake/> and the online manual <https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/>.
