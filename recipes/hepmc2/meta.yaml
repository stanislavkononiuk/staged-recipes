  summary: 'HepMC - a C++ Event Record for Monte Carlo Generators'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
           The HepMC package is an object oriented, C++ event record
           for High Energy Physics Monte Carlo generators and simulation.
           The original code was written by M. Dobbs and J.B. Hansen
            (Comput. Phys. Commun. 134 (2001) 41). Since the first 
           implementation, the package has undergone several modifications
           and in particular, the latest HepMC3 series is a completely new
           re-write using currently available C++11 techniques.
