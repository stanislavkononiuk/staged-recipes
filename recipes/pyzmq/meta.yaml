# On Windows ZeroMQ is bundled with pyzmq.
# On Windows pyzmq includes tweetnacl so libsodium is not used.
# We should revisit these in the future. However, packaging libsodium
# on Windows is complicated by the fact that they ship project files,
# but don't include one for VS 2008, which we would need for Python 2.7.
