This software is distributed under the license described below, which is compliant with the Open Source Initiative
found at http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd. You are not licensed to use or modify this software unless you
agree to all of the licensing terms below:
1. Derived Works and Integrity of The Author’s Source Code: Derived works must be distributed under exactly the
same terms as this license. The source code is restricted from being distributed in modified form; however,
this license allows the distribution of “patch files” with the source code for the purpose of modifying the
program at build time.
2. Free Redistribution: The license does not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a
component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The
license does not require a royalty or other fee for such a sale. This license does not restrict other software that
may be distributed along with the licensed software.
3. Source Code: The program includes source code, and allows distribution in source code as well as compiled
form. (Deliberately obfuscated source code and intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or
translator are not allowed.)
4. Distribution of License: The rights attached to the program apply to all to whom the program is redistributed
without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.
5. Scientific publications that use computational results of the program are required to properly cite the original
research papers describing the methods used in the program, according to best scientific practice.
