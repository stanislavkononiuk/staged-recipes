  summary: 'Conventional methods for producing standard scores in psychometrics or biometrics
    are often plagued with "jumps" or "gaps" (i.e., discontinuities) in norm tables
    and low confidence for assessing extreme scores. The continuous norming method introduced
    by A. Lenhard et al. (2016, <doi:10.1177/1073191116656437>; 2019, <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0222279>)
    and generates continuous test norm scores on the basis of the raw data from standardization
    samples, without requiring assumptions about the distribution of the raw data: Norm
    scores are directly established from raw data by modeling the latter ones as a function
    of both percentile scores and an explanatory variable (e.g., age). The method minimizes
    bias arising from sampling and measurement error, while handling marked deviations
    from normality, addressing bottom or ceiling effects and capturing almost all of
    the variance in the original norm data sample. An online demonstration is available
    via <https://cnorm.shinyapps.io/cNORM/>.'
