  summary: A tool for producing synthetic versions of microdata containing confidential information
    so that they are safe to be released to users for exploratory analysis. The key
    objective of generating synthetic data is to replace sensitive original values with
    synthetic ones causing minimal distortion of the statistical information contained
    in the data set. Variables, which can be categorical or continuous, are synthesised
    one-by-one using sequential modelling. Replacements are generated by drawing from
    conditional distributions fitted to the original data using parametric or classification
    and regression trees models. Data are synthesised via the function syn() which can
    be largely automated, if default settings are used, or with methods defined by the
    user. Optional parameters can be used to influence the disclosure risk and the analytical
    quality of the synthesised data. For a description of the implemented method see
    Nowok, Raab and Dibben (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v074.i11>.
