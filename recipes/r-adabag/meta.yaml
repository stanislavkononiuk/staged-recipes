  summary: It implements Freund and Schapire's Adaboost.M1 algorithm and Breiman's Bagging algorithm
    using classification trees as individual classifiers. Once these classifiers have
    been trained, they can be used to predict on new data. Also, cross validation estimation
    of the error can be done. Since version 2.0 the function margins() is available
    to calculate the margins for these classifiers. Also a higher flexibility is achieved
    giving access to the rpart.control() argument of 'rpart'. Four important new features
    were introduced on version 3.0, AdaBoost-SAMME (Zhu et al., 2009) is implemented
    and a new function errorevol() shows the error of the ensembles as a function of
    the number of iterations. In addition, the ensembles can be pruned using the option
    'newmfinal' in the predict.bagging() and predict.boosting() functions and the posterior
    probability of each class for observations can be obtained. Version 3.1 modifies
    the relative importance measure to take into account the gain of the Gini index
    given by a variable in each tree and the weights of these trees. Version 4.0 includes
    the margin-based ordered aggregation for Bagging pruning (Guo and Boukir, 2013)
    and a function to auto prune the 'rpart' tree. Moreover, three new plots are also
    available importanceplot(), plot.errorevol() and plot.margins(). Version 4.1 allows
    to predict on unlabeled data. Version 4.2 includes the parallel computation option
    for some of the functions.
