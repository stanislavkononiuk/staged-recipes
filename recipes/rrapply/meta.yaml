  summary: The minimal 'rrapply'-package contains a single function rrapply(), providing an extended
    implementation of 'R'-base rapply() by allowing to recursively apply a function
    to elements of a nested list based on a general condition function and including
    the possibility to prune or aggregate nested list elements from the result. In addition,
    special arguments can be supplied to access the name, location, parents and siblings
    in the nested list of the element under evaluation. The rrapply() function builds
    upon rapply()'s native 'C' implementation and requires no other package dependencies.
