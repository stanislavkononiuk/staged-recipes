  summary: A utility that computes astrometric solutions from SExtractor catalogs
  description: |
    SCAMP (Software for Calibrating AstroMetry and Photometry) is a computer
    program that computes astrometric projection parameters from source
    catalogues derived from FITS images. The computed solution is expressed
    according to the WCS standard.
