  summary: 'Make your user-facing Celery jobs totally awesomer'

  description: |
    Jobtastic makes your user-responsive long-running Celery jobs totally awesomer. 
    Celery is the ubiquitous python job queueing tool and jobtastic is a python 
    library that adds useful features to your Celery tasks. Specifically, these are
    features you probably want if the results of your jobs are expensive or if your 
    users need to wait while they compute their results.
