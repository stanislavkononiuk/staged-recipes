  summary: Provides a minimal R and C++ API for parsing well-known binary and well-known text
    representation of geometries to and from R-native formats. Well-known binary is
    compact and fast to parse; well-known text is human-readable and is useful for writing
    tests. These formats are only useful in R if the information they contain can be
    accessed in R, for which high-performance functions are provided here.
