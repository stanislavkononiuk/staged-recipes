      This is the Minuit2 fitter standalone edition, from the ROOT toolkit.
      For information about the Minuit2 fitter, please see the documentation in ROOT.
  description: |
      The Minuit2 library is a new object-oriented implementation, written in C++, of the popular
      MINUIT minimization package. These new version provides basically all the functionality
      present in the old Fortran version, with almost equivalent numerical accuracy and
      computational performances. Furthermore, it contains new functionality, like the possibility
      to set single side parameter limits or the FUMILI algorithm, which is an optimized method for
      least square and log likelihood minimizations. The package has been originally developed by
      M. Winkler and F. James. More information on the new C++ version can be found on the MINUIT
      Web Site.
