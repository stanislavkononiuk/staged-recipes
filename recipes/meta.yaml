  summary: 'Parallel FFT in 3D or 2D using MPI for Python. Slab or pencil decomposition possible in 3D.'
  description: |
    mpiFFT4py performs FFTs in parallel in Python. It is developed to be able
    to do FFTs in parallel on a three-dimensional computational box
    (a structured grid), but there are also routines for doing the FFTs on a
    2D mesh. It implements both the slab and the pencil decompositions.
