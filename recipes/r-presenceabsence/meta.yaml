  summary: This package provides a set of functions useful when evaluating the results of presence-absence
    models. Package includes functions for calculating threshold dependent measures
    such as confusion matrices, pcc, sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa, and produces
    plots of each measure as the threshold is varied. It will calculate optimal threshold
    choice according to a choice of optimization criteria. It also includes functions
    to plot the threshold independent ROC curves along with the associated AUC (area
    under the curve).
