  summary: 'Sounding/Hodograph Analysis and Research Program for Python'
  description: |
        SHARPpy is a collection of open source sounding and hodograph analysis routines, a sounding plotting package, 
        and an interactive, cross-platform application for analyzing real-time soundings all written in Python. 
        It was developed to provide the atmospheric science community a free and consistent source of sounding analysis 
        routines. SHARPpy is updated and vetted by professional meteorologists and climatologists within the scientific
        community to help maintain a standard source of sounding routines.
