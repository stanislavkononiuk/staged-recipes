  summary: 'Tools for creating and manipulating shapes.'

  description: |
    coxeter is used for working with polytopes and other shapes.
    The package is focused on providing robust methods for computing
    standard geometric quantities, particularly for polytopes where
    implementing such calculations for generic shapes requires care
    to properly handle convexity, proper vertex ordering, and other
    related issues.
