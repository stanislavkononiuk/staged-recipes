  description: "This package provides a Jupyter notebook for reducing CCD data.\n\nDocumentation is at: https://reducer.readthedocs.org\n\n.. image:: http://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-AstroPy-orange.svg?style=flat\
    \ :target:http://astropy.org\n\nPlease provide feedback\n=======================\n\nComments are very, very much welcome. Please comment by `making a new\nissue on Github <https://github.com/mwcraig/reducer/issues>`__\
    \ (if, by\nchance, a reasonably senior academic is using this, you can send\nfeedback by email; anyone else should *really* create a github account\nso you can make an issue :)).\n\nInstallation\n============\n\
    \n\n**Note about IPython/Jupyter version support:** Version 0.3 and higher of\nreducer works with IPython 4/Jupyter. Version 0.1 works with IPython 2, and\nVersion 0.2.x work with IPython 3 or IPython\
    \ 4/Jupyter. No improvements to\n``reducer`` will be backported to version 0.1.x/IPython 2 or to 0.2.x/IPYthon\n3. Feel free to fork if you need that!\n\nYou need python (2.7, or 3.4 or higher) and\
    \ the `SciPy\nstack <http://scipy.org>`__. The easiest way to the get the full stack\nis from a distribution like `anaconda <http://continuum.io>`__.\n\nOn Windows it will be easiest to install using\
    \ the Anaconda Python\ndistribution and ``conda`` (because everything has been compiled for you).\n\nTo install using ``conda``:\n\n::\n\n    conda install -c mwcraig -c astropy reducer\n\n\nIf you\
    \ prefer, you can install with pip in any python distribution (but may\nend up compiling some of the dependencies):\n\n::\n\n    pip install reducer\n\n\nYou can, if you want, grab the source on github\
    \ (there is a \"Download as\nZIP\" link on the right you can use if you don't want to mess git),\nchange into the source directory, and run ``python setup.py install``.\n\n.. note::\n\n    `reducer`\
    \ comes with a small set of images; the download size is roughly\n    13MB. It is provided so you can try the notebook without needing your own\n    data. If you run the notebook as-is then the sample\
    \ images will get\n    expanded to 300MB in a temporary directory.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThis package doesn't magically do your reduction for you. Instead, it\ncreates a template `jupyter notebook <http://jupyter.org>`_\
    \ that leads\nyou through data reduction. When you are done\nyou have reduced your data and *you have a notebook that allows you or\nsomeone else to reproduce your work*.\n\nIn a terminal, navigate\
    \ to the directory where you want to keep the\nnotebook for doing your reduction (which does not have to be the same\ndirectory where the data is, though it can be), then type::\n\n    reducer\n\nThis\
    \ will create a new template notebook. To open the notebook, type\nin a terminal::\n\n    jupyter notebook\n\nA browser window will open; the notebook you want is named \"reduction.ipynb\".\nClick on\
    \ it, then just do what it says in the notebook and reduced data (and\nsomeday photometry!) will be yours.\n\nUnder the hood\n==============\n\nIf you look at the source code you'll notice pretty quickly\
    \ that there\nis no actual *science* code. Think of this as the glue that brings\ntogether a couple related packages:\n\n-  `ccdproc <http://github.com/astropy/ccdproc>`__ for the actual data\n   reduction.\n\
      -  `astropy <http://github.com/astropy>`__ for lots of the underlying\n   structure .\n"
