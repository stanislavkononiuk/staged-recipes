  description: |
    hashdeep, is a set of cross-platform tools to compute hashes, or message digests,
    for any number of files while optionally recursively digging through the directory structure.
    It can also take a list of known hashes and display the filenames of input files whose hashes
    either do or do not match any of the known hashes.
    This version supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Tiger, and Whirlpool hashes.
