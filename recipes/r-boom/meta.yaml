  summary: A C++ library for Bayesian modeling, with an emphasis on Markov chain Monte Carlo.  Although
    boom contains a few R utilities (mainly plotting functions), its primary purpose
    is to install the BOOM C++ library on your system so that other packages can link
    against it.

# Package: Boom
# Version: 0.9.2
# Date: 2019-09-01
# Title: Bayesian Object Oriented Modeling
# Author: Steven L. Scott is the sole author and creator of the BOOM project. Some code in the BOOM libraries has been modified from other open source projects.  These include Cephes (obtained from Netlib, written by Stephen L. Moshier), NEWUOA (M.J.D Powell, obtained from Powell's web site), and a modified version of the R math libraries (R core development team).  Original copyright notices have been maintained in all source files.  In these cases, copyright claimed by Steven L. Scott is limited to modifications made to the original code.  Google claims copyright for code written while Steven L. Scott was employed at Google from 2008 - 2018, but BOOM is not an officially supported Google project.
