  summary: lhorizon helps you find where things are in the solar system
  description: lhorizon helps you find where things are in the solar system. It is built around a thick Python wrapper for the 
      Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Horizons (https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons) service. Horizons, provided by JPL's
      Solar System Dynamics Group (SSD), is the only service in the world that offers no-assembly-required high-precision 
      geometry data for almost every known body in the solar system. lhorizon offers tools to query Horizons for data, 
      parse its responses into useful Python objects, and smoothly incorporate them into bulk calculation and transformation 
      workflows.
