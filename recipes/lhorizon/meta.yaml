  summary: lhorizon helps you find where things are in the solar system
  description: `lhorizon` helps you find where things are in the solar system. It is built around a thick Python wrapper for the 
      Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) [Horizons](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons) service. _Horizons_, provided by JPL's
      Solar System Dynamics Group (SSD), is the only service in the world that offers no-assembly-required high-precision 
      geometry data for almost every known body in the solar system. `lhorizon` offers tools to query _Horizons_ for data, 
      parse its responses into useful Python objects, and smoothly incorporate them into bulk calculation and transformation 
      workflows.
