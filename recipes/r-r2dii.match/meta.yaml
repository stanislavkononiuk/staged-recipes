  summary: These tools implement in R a fundamental part of the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement
    Capital Transition Assessment), which is a free tool that calculates the alignment
    between financial portfolios and climate scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
    Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital allocation decisions
    align with climate change mitigation goals. This package matches data from corporate
    lending portfolios to asset level data from market-intelligence databases (e.g.
    power plant capacities, emission factors, etc.). This is the first step to assess
    if a financial portfolio aligns with climate goals.
