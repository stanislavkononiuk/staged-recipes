  summary: 'Robust and stable clustering of molecular dynamics simulation trajectories'

  description: |
    This software package provides extensive tools for fast, robust and 
    stable clustering of molecular dynamics trajectories. The essential 
    functions are density-based geometric clustering for microstate generation, 
    dynamic clustering based on the Most-Probable-Path algorithm (MPP),
    variable dynamic coring for boundary corrections, and dynamic noise 
    assignment. Additionally, the package includes tools to efficiently 
    filter original coordinates or order parameters based on a discrete 
    state definition to identify representative structures and variables of 
    clusters.
