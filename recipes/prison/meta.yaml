  description: |
    Rison is a data serialization format optimized for compactness in URIs.
    Rison is a slight variation of JSON that looks vastly superior after URI
    encoding. Rison still expresses exactly the same set of data structures as
    JSON, so data can be translated back and forth without loss or guesswork.
