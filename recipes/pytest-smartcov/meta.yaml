  summary: Smart coverage measurement for py.test.

  description: |
    Smart coverage measurement and reporting for py.test test suites.

    Test suites are usually structured parallel to (or integrated with) the
    structure of the code they test. If you ask py.test to run a certain subset
    of your tests, you shouldn't have to also tell coverage which subset of
    your code it should measure coverage on for that run. With pytest-smartcov,
    you don't have to.
