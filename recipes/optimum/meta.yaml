  description: |
    ðŸ¤— Optimum is an extension of ðŸ¤— Transformers, providing a set of performance 
    optimization tools enabling maximum efficiency to train and run models on 
    targeted hardware.

    The AI ecosystem evolves quickly and more and more specialized hardware along 
    with their own optimizations are emerging every day. As such, Optimum enables 
    users to efficiently use any of these platforms with the same ease inherent 
    to transformers.
