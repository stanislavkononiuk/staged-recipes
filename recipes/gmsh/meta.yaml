  summary: A three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities
  description: |
    Gmsh is a free 3D finite element grid generator with a build-in CAD
    engine and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light
    and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced
    visualization capabilities. Gmsh is built around four modules:
    geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing. The specification of any
    input to these modules is done either interactively using the graphical
    user interface or in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting
    language.
