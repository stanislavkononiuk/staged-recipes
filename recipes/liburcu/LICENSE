* LGPLv2.1

The library part is distributed under LGPLv2.1 or later. See lgpl-2.1.txt for
license details. Refer to the individual file headers for details.

LGPL-compatible source code can statically use the library header using :

#define _LGPL_SOURCE
#include <urcu.h>

Dynamic-only linking with the LGPL library is used if _LGPL_SOURCE is not
defined. It permits relinking with newer versions of the library, which is
required by the LGPL license.

See lgpl-relicensing.txt for details.


* MIT-style license :

xchg() primitive has been rewritten from scratch starting from atomic_ops 1.2
which has a MIT-style license that is intended to allow use in both free and
proprietary software:
