  summary: Backport of PEP 562
  description: |
    A backport of PEP 562. Allows controlling a module's __dir__ and
    __getattr__. Useful for deprecating attributes. Works for Python 2.7+. And
    while it works on Python 3.7, it is recommended to use the official Python
    3.7 implementation where applicable.

    This module can be installed and used as a dependency, or if desired, it is
    easy to vendor as the license is quite permissible, and the code is
    contained in a single file.

    Once Python 3.6 is end of life, this module will be irrelevant and will no
    longer receive active support.
