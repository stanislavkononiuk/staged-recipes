  description: |-
    Atheris is a coverage-guided Python fuzzing engine. It supports fuzzing of
    Python code, but also native extensions written for CPython. Atheris is based
    off of libFuzzer. When fuzzing native code, Atheris can be used in combination
    with Address Sanitizer or Undefined Behavior Sanitizer to catch extra bugs.
