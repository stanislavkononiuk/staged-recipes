  summary: Methods for plotting categorical longitudinal and time-series data by mapping individuals
    to the vertical space (each horizontal line represents a participant), time (or
    repeated measures) to the horizontal space, categorical (or discrete) states as
    facets using color or shade, and events to points using plotting characters. Sorting
    individuals in the vertical space and (or) stratifying them by groups can reveal
    patterns in the changes over time.
