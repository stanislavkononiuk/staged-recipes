  summary: Live code in Pandoc Markdown
  description: |
    Codebraid is a Python program that enables executable code in Pandoc Markdown
    documents. Using Codebraid can be as simple as adding a class to your code
    blocks' attributes, and then running codebraid rather than pandoc to convert
    your document from Markdown to another format. codebraid supports almost all
    of pandoc's options and passes them to pandoc internally.
