  summary: 'Lambert W x F distributions are a generalized framework to analyze skewed, heavy-tailed
    data. It is based on an input/output system, where the output random variable (RV)
    Y is a non-linearly transformed version of an input RV X ~ F with similar properties
    as X, but slightly skewed (heavy-tailed). The transformed RV Y has a Lambert W x
    F distribution. This package contains functions to model and analyze skewed, heavy-tailed
    data the Lambert Way: simulate random samples, estimate parameters, compute quantiles,
    and plot/ print results nicely. Probably the most important function is ''Gaussianize'',
    which works similarly to ''scale'', but actually makes the data Gaussian. A do-it-yourself
    toolkit allows users to define their own Lambert W x ''MyFavoriteDistribution''
    and use it in their analysis right away.'
