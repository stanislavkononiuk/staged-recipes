  summary: "Conda Environment Management, Builds, and Serve"
  description: |
    End users think in terms of environments not packages. The core
    philosophy of conda-store is to serve identical conda environments
    in as many ways as possible. Conda Store controls the environment
    lifecycle: management, builds, and serving of environments.
