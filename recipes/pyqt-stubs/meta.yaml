  summary: Mypy stubs for the PyQt5 framework
  description: |
    The stub files released within the PyQt5 packages have been modified to allow using them for type-checking via mypy.
    Improvements over the default stubs include:

    QFlags derived classes correctly support all combination operations
    Many methods accepting an optional None have been annotated so
