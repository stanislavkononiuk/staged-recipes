  summary: Functions for the hyperbolic and related distributions. Density, distribution and
    quantile functions and random number generation are provided for the hyperbolic
    distribution, the generalized hyperbolic distribution, the generalized inverse Gaussian
    distribution and the skew-Laplace distribution. Additional functionality is provided
    for the hyperbolic distribution, normal inverse Gaussian distribution and generalized
    inverse Gaussian distribution, including fitting of these distributions to data.
    Linear models with hyperbolic errors may be fitted using hyperblmFit.
