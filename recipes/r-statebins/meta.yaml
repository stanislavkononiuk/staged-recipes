  summary: The 'cartogram' heatmaps generated by the included methods are an alternative to choropleth
    maps for the United States and are based on work by the Washington Post graphics
    department in their report on "The states most threatened by trade" (<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/states-most-threatened-by-trade/>).
    "State bins" preserve as much of the geographic placement of the states as possible
    but have the look and feel of a traditional heatmap. Functions are provided that
    allow for use of a binned, discrete scale, a continuous scale or manually specified
    colors depending on what is needed for the underlying data.
