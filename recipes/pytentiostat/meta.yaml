  summary: 'python code to run the JUAMI potentiostat'

  description: |
    The JUAMI potentiostat is a cheap (<$100) potentiostat built on the Arduino platform
    for use in classroom demonstrations and simple research.  It can carry out
    electrochemical scans such as one would use for testing performance of an
    electrochemical cell or battery.  It was developed by a team from JUAMI, the
    joint undertaking for an African Materials Institute (www.juami.org) which has
    a mission to help develop research collaborations in materials science between
    US and African researchers.  Pytentiostat is python code for running the
    potentiostat.  For more information, contact Prof. Simon Billinge at email
