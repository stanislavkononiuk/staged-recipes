  summary: "Python version of Mapbox Earcut library: fast and quite robust triangulation of 2D polygons."
  description: |
    The library implements a modified ear slicing algorithm, optimized by z-order
    curve hashing and extended to handle holes, twisted polygons, degeneracies and
    self-intersections in a way that doesn't guarantee correctness of triangulation,
    but attempts to always produce acceptable results for practical data like
    geographical shapes.
