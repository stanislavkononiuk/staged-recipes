  summary: A first-principles materials simulation code using DFT
  description: |
    SIESTA is both a method and its computer program implementation,
    to perform efficient electronic structure calculations and ab initio
    molecular dynamics simulations of molecules and solids. SIESTA's
    efficiency stems from the use of strictly localized basis sets and
    from the implementation of linear-scaling algorithms which can be
    applied to suitable systems. A very important feature of the code is
    that its accuracy and cost can be tuned in a wide range, from quick
    exploratory calculations to highly accurate simulations matching the
    quality of other approaches, such as plane-wave and all-electron methods.
