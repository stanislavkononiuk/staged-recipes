  summary: Bayesian nonstationary, semiparametric nonlinear regression and design by treed Gaussian
    processes (GPs) with jumps to the limiting linear model (LLM).  Special cases also
    implemented include Bayesian linear models, CART, treed linear models, stationary
    separable and isotropic GPs, and GP single-index models.  Provides 1-d and 2-d plotting
    functions (with projection and slice capabilities) and tree drawing, designed for
    visualization of tgp-class output.  Sensitivity analysis and multi-resolution models
    are supported. Sequential experimental design and adaptive sampling functions are
    also provided, including ALM, ALC, and expected improvement.  The latter supports
    derivative-free optimization of noisy black-box functions.  For details and tutorials,
    see Gramacy (2007) <doi:10.18637/jss.v019.i09> and Gramacy & Taddy (2010) <doi:10.18637/jss.v033.i06>.
