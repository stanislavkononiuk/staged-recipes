  summary: 'Scaling, colorspace conversion, and dithering library'
  description: |
    The "z" library implements the commonly required image processing basics of scaling,
    colorspace conversion, and depth conversion.
    A simple API enables conversion between any supported formats
    to operate with minimal knowledge from the programmer.
    All library routines were designed from the ground-up
    with correctness, flexibility, and thread-safety as first priorities.
    Allocation, buffering, and I/O are cleanly separated from processing,
    allowing the programmer to adapt "z" to many scenarios.
