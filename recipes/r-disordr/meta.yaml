  summary: Functionality for manipulating values of associative maps.  Ordinary R vectors are
    unsuitable for working with values of associative maps because elements of an R
    vector may be accessed by reference to their location in the vector, but associative
    maps are stored in arbitrary order.  However, when associating keys with values
    one needs both parts to be in 1-1 correspondence, so one cannot dispense with the
    order entirely.  The 'disordR' package includes a single S4 class, disord.  This
    class allows one to perform only those operations appropriate for manipulating values
    of associative maps and prevents any other operation (such as accessing an element
    at a particular location).  A useful heuristic is that one is only allowed to access
    or modify a disord object using a python list comprehension.  The idea is to prevent
    ill-defined operations on values (or keys) of associative maps, whose order is undefined
    or at best implementation-specific, while allowing and facilitating sensible operations.  The
    package is needed for development versions of 'mvp', 'hyper2', 'spray', 'clifford',
    and 'freealg'.
