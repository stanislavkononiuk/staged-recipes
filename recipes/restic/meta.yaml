  description: |
    Restic is a modern backup program that can back up your files
    from Linux, BSD, Mac and Windows
    to many different storage types, including self-hosted and online services
    easily, being a single executable that you can run without a server or complex setup
    effectively, only transferring the parts that actually changed in the files you back up
    securely, by careful use of cryptography in every part of the process
    verifiably, enabling you to make sure that your files can be restored when needed
    freely - restic is entirely free to use and completely open source
