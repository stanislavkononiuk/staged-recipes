# Notes
# 
# - `niftiio`, `openexr` and `libheif` are missing
# 
# - `imagemagick` is built with `jpeg`, not `libjpeg-turbo`, so we must use
#   `jpeg` too. This is very unfortunate. It would be good if IM could move
#   to turbo as well.

  summary: 'A fast image processing library with low memory needs'
  description: |
    libvips is a demand-driven, horizontally threaded image processing
    library. Compared to similar libraries, libvips runs quickly and uses
    little memory.  It has around 300 operations covering arithmetic,
    histograms, convolution, morphological operations, frequency filtering,
    colour, resampling, statistics and others. It supports a large range of
    numeric formats, from 8-bit int to 128-bit complex. Images can have any
    number of bands. It supports a good range of image formats, including
    JPEG, TIFF, OME-TIFF, PNG, WebP, FITS, Matlab, PDF, SVG, HDR,
    PPM, CSV, GIF, Analyze, DeepZoom, and OpenSlide. It can also load images
    via ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick, letting it load formats like DICOM.
