  summary: 'A video processing framework with simplicity in mind'
  description: |
    VapourSynth is an application for video manipulation. Or a plugin. Or a library.
    It's hard to tell because it has a core library written in C++
    and a Python module to allow video scripts to be created.

    The core library is `{{ name|lower }}-core` and the Python wrapper is `{{ name|lower }}`.
