  description: |
    Finding reservations at sold out campgrounds can be tough. That's where
     camply comes in. It searches the APIs of booking services like 
     https://recreation.gov (which indexes thousands of campgrounds across the
     USA) to continuously check for cancellations and availabilities to pop up.
     Once a campsite becomes available, camply sends you a notification to book
     your spot!
