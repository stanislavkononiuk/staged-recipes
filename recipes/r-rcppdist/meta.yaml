  summary: 'The ''Rcpp'' package provides a C++ library to make it easier to use C++ with R.
    R and ''Rcpp'' provide functions for a variety of statistical distributions. Several
    R packages make functions available to R for additional statistical distributions.
    However, to access these functions from C++ code, a costly call to the R functions
    must be made. ''RcppDist'' provides a header-only C++ library with functions for
    additional statistical distributions that can be called from C++ when writing code
    using ''Rcpp'' or ''RcppArmadillo''. Functions are available that return a ''NumericVector''
    as well as doubles, and for multivariate or matrix distributions, ''Armadillo''
    vectors and matrices. ''RcppDist'' provides functions for the following distributions:
    the four parameter beta distribution; the location- scale t distribution; the truncated
    normal distribution; the truncated t distribution; a truncated location-scale t
    distribution; the triangle distribution; the multivariate normal distribution*;
    the multivariate t distribution*; the Wishart distribution*; and the inverse Wishart
    distribution*. Distributions marked with an asterisk rely on ''RcppArmadillo''.'
