  description: |
    Dragonfly is a speech recognition framework for Python that makes it convenient to
    create custom commands to use with speech recognition software. It was written
    to make it very easy for Python macros, scripts, and applications to interface
    with speech recognition engines. Its design allows speech commands and grammar
    objects to be treated as first-class Python objects.
