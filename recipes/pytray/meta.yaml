  summary: A python tools library for baking pies
  description: |
    A collection of small utility libraries covering things such as pretty printing, using asyncio on a separate thread,
    weakly referencing objects by id in a dictionary and others.  These are things I have found useful across several
    projects I have been involved in including kiwiPy, mincePy, minkiPy, pyOS and you can find usage examples therein.
