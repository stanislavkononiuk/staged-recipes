  summary: 'Unit test your Jupyter Notebooks the right way'

  description: |
    testbook is a unit testing framework extension for testing code in Jupyter Notebooks.

    Previous attempts at unit testing notebooks involved writing the tests in the notebook 
    itself. However, testbook will allow for unit tests to be run against notebooks in 
    separate test files, hence treating .ipynb files as .py files.

    testbook helps you set up conventional unit tests for your Jupyter Notebooks.
