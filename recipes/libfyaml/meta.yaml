  summary: 'Fully feature complete YAML parser and emitter'
  description: |
    A fancy 1.2 YAML and JSON parser/writer.

    Fully feature complete YAML parser and emitter, supporting the latest
    YAML spec and passing the full YAML testsuite.

    It is designed to be very efficient, avoiding copies of data, and
    has no artificial limits like the 1024 character limit for implicit keys.

    libfyaml is using <https://github.com/yaml/yaml-test-suite>
    as a core part of it's testsuite.
