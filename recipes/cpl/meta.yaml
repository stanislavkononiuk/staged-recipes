    # libcurl is not a direct dependency of CPL, but libtool links CPL to it because
    # pkg-config detects libcurl, probably due to this cfitsio recipe patch:
    # https://github.com/conda-forge/cfitsio-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/lcurl-pkg-config.patch
    # If we were to manually tell libtool not to do so, libtool links to libnsl.
    # So we either need to include libnsl here and do some funky replacements
    # in all the Makefiles, or just include libcurl here.

  summary: 'A software toolkit to develop astronomical data-reduction tasks'
  description: |
    The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries 
    that provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit 
    to develop astronomical data-reduction tasks (known as "recipes"). 
    These data-reduction tasks can then be executed manually by a user, 
    or can be triggered in an automated data-reduction framework (known
    as "pipelines") which are used at ESO to monitor the health status
    of VLT instruments, for quick-look data processing at the observatory, 
    and the creation of data products available from the ESO archive facility.
