  summary: A Path interface for local and cloud bucket storage
  description: |
    Pathy is a python package (with type annotations) for working with Bucket
    storage providers. It provides a CLI app for basic file operations between
    local files and remote buckets. It enables a smooth developer experience by
    supporting local file-system backed buckets during development and testing.
    It makes converting bucket blobs into local files a snap with optional
    local file caching of blobs.
