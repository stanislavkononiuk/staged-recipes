  description: |
    Telepath provides a mechanism for packing structured data, including Python
    objects, into a JSON-serializable format. This mechanism can be extended to
    support any Python class, by registering the class with a corresponding
    JavaScript implementation. The packed data can then be included in an HTTP
    response, and unpacked in JavaScript to obtain an equivalent data structure
    to the original. Think of it as pickle, but with the unpickling happening in
    the browser.
