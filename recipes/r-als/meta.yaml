  summary: Alternating least squares is often used to resolve components contributing to data
    with a bilinear structure; the basic technique may be extended to alternating constrained
    least squares.  Commonly applied constraints include unimodality, non-negativity,
    and normalization of components. Several data matrices may be decomposed simultaneously
    by assuming that one of the two matrices in the bilinear decomposition is shared
    between datasets.
