  summary: Provides interactive, configurable and elegant graphics visualization of the chromosomes
    or chromosome regions of any living organism allowing users to map chromosome elements
    (like genes, SNPs etc.) on the chromosome plot. It introduces a special plot viz.
    the "chromosome heatmap" that, in addition to mapping elements, can visualize the
    data associated with chromosome elements (like gene expression) in the form of heat
    colors which can be highly advantageous in the scientific interpretations and research
    work. Because of the large size of the chromosomes, it is impractical to visualize
    each element on the same plot. However, the plot provides a magnified view for each
    of chromosome locus to render additional information and visualization specific
    for that location. You can map thousands of genes and can view all mappings easily.
    Users can investigate the detailed information about the mappings (like gene names
    or total genes mapped on a location) or can view the magnified single or double
    stranded view of the chromosome at a location showing each mapped element in sequential
    order. The package provide multiple features like visualizing multiple sets, chromosome
    heat-maps, group annotations, adding hyperlinks, and labelling. The plots can be
    saved as HTML documents that can be customized and shared easily. In addition, you
    can include them in R Markdown or in R 'Shiny' applications.
