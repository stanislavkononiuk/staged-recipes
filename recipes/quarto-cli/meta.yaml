  patches:
    # TODO: I gave up on path override stuff for windows. You have to do setlocal enabledelayedexpansion and then endlocal after,
    #    passing the variables out from the setlocal section. That was a headache, so I punted and just patch the hard-coded values
    #    in the quarto setup script. The right way to do this is to figure out how to allow the variables to be overridden in the
    #    generated win_configuration.bat file.

    # Deno, deno-dom and pandoc have proven to be fickle
    #    regarding Quarto's source code. The pinning here

    #    issues, but just that these dependencies are only
    #    known to work in a pretty narrow range.
