  summary: 'Software abstractions for the analog signal exploration tools'
  description: |
    libsmu contains abstractions for streaming data to and from USB-connected
    analog interface devices, currently supporting the Analog Devices' ADALM1000.
    Building off of LibUSB for cross-platform operation, it offers the sourcing
    of repeated waveforms, configuration of hardware, and measuring of signals.
