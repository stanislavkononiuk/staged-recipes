  summary: A collection of numerical permafrost models.
  description: |
    PermaModel project enables the broader use of permafrost models and
    consists of several permafrost models representing a range of
    capability and complexity. The PermaModel provides easy online access to
    everyone who want to use permafrost models, but lack the expertise and
    resources to develop them. It includes multiple sets of sample inputs
    representing a variety of conditions and locations to enable immediate
    use of any out of three permafrost models. It is built on the Community
    Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) Modeling Framework platform.
    CSDMS provides an on-line environment where users can link and run models
    from multiple Earth science disciplines. We hope that the simple user
    interfaces, easy online access, open source models, and quick visualization
    tools can make permafrost models accessible to a broad audience well
    beyond the permafrost research community. These new easy-to-use modeling
    tools could be useful to wide-range of users beyond the research community,
    such as educators, students, and policy-makers.
