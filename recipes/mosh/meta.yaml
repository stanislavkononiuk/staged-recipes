  summary: 'Mobile shell that supports roaming and intelligent local echo'

  description: |
      Mosh is a remote terminal application that supports:
          - intermittent network connectivity,
          - roaming to different IP address without dropping the connection, and
          - intelligent local echo and line editing to reduce the effects
            of "network lag" on high-latency connections.
