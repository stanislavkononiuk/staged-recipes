  summary: "JupyterHub Spawner using systemd for resource isolation"
  description: |
    If you want to use Linux Containers (Docker, rkt, etc) for isolation and
    security benefits, but don't want the headache and complexity of container
    image management, then you should use the SystemdSpawner.

    With the systemdspawner, you get to use the familiar, traditional system
    administration tools, whether you love or meh them, without having to learn
    an extra layer of container related tooling.
