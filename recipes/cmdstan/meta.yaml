  summary: 'CmdStan, the command line interface to Stan'
  description: |
    <b>CmdStan</b> is the command line interface to Stan, a package providing

    * full Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS), a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC),
    * penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using optimization, either Newton or quasi-Newton algorithms BFGS and L-BFGS,
    * approximate Bayesian inference using automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI),
    * a full first- and higher-order automatic differentiation library based on C++ template overloads, and
    * a supporting fully-templated matrix, linear algebra, and probability special function library.
