  summary: Partitioning clustering algorithms divide data sets into k subsets or partitions so-called
    clusters. They require some initialization procedures for starting to partition
    the data sets. Initialization of cluster prototypes is one of such kind of procedures
    for most of the partitioning algorithms. Cluster prototypes are the data elements,
    i.e. centroids or medoids, representing the clusters in a data set. In order to
    initialize cluster prototypes, the package 'inaparc' contains a set of the functions
    that are the implementations of several linear time-complexity and loglinear time-complexity
    methods in addition to some novel techniques. Initialization of fuzzy membership
    degrees matrices is another important task for starting the probabilistic and possibilistic
    partitioning algorithms. In order to initialize membership degrees matrices required
    by these algorithms, a number of functions based on some traditional and novel initialization
    techniques are also available in the package 'inaparc'.
