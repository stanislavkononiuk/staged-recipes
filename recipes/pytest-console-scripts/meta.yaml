  summary: 'Pytest plugin for testing console scripts'
  description: |
    Pytest-console-scripts is a Pytest plugin for testing python
    scripts installed via console_scripts entry point of setup.py.
    It can run the scripts under test in a separate process or using
    the interpreter that's running the test suite. The former mode
    ensures that the script will run in an environment that is
    identical to normal execution whereas the latter one allows
    much quicker test runs during development while simulating the
    real runs as much as possible.
