  description: |
    This is the code for the Arctic Observation Operator for 6.9 GHz, presented in: Burgard, C., Notz, D., Pedersen, L. T., 
    and Tonboe, R. T.: The Arctic Ocean Observation Operator for 6.9 GHz (ARC3O) – Part 2: Development and evaluation, 
    The Cryosphere, 14, 2387–2407, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2387-2020, 2020.
    ! Please be careful when using the code !
    Especially, there might not be an error message when ran at another polarization or frequency than 6.9 GHz, 
    vertical polarization, but the results have only be evaluated at that frequency and polarization!
    If you are interested in 6.9 GHz, vertical polarization, enjoy! :)
