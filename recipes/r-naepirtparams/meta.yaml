  summary: This data package contains the Item Response Theory (IRT) parameters for the National
    Center for Education Statistics (NCES) items used on the National Assessment of
    Education Progress (NAEP) from 1990 to 2015. The values in these tables are used
    along with NAEP data to turn student item responses into scores and include information
    about item difficulty, discrimination, and guessing parameter for 3 parameter logit
    (3PL) items. Parameters for Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM) items are also
    included. The adjustments table contains the information regarding the treatment
    of items (e.g., deletion of an item or a collapsing of response categories), when
    these items did not appear to fit the item response models used to describe the
    NAEP data. Transformation constants change the score estimates that are obtained
    from the IRT scaling program to the NAEP reporting metric. Values from the years
    2000 - 2013 were taken from the NCES website <https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/>
    and values from 1990 - 1998 and 2015 were extracted from their NAEP data files.
    All subtest names were reduced and homogenized to one word (e.g. "Reading to gain
    information" became "information"). The various subtest names for univariate transformation
    constants were all homogenized to "univariate".
