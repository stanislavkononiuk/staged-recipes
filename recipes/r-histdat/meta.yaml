  summary: Summary Statistics for Histogram/Count Data
  description: In some cases you will have data in a histogram format, where you
    have a vector of all possible observations, and a vector of how
    many times each observation appeared.  You could expand this into
    a single 1D vector, but this may not be advisable if the counts
    are extremely large. 'HistDat' allows for the calculation of
    summary statistics without the need for expanding your data.
