  summary: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used and have various applications in classification  or
    regression. Models created with boosting, bagging, stacking or similar techniques
    are often used due to their high performance, but such black-box models usually
    lack of interpretability. DALEX package contains various explainers that help to
    understand the link between input variables and model output. The single_variable()
    explainer extracts conditional response of a model as a function of a single selected
    variable. It is a wrapper over packages 'pdp' (Greenwell 2017) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2017-016>,  'ALEPlot'
    (Apley 2018) <arXiv:1612.08468>  and 'factorMerger' (Sitko and Biecek 2017) <arXiv:1709.04412>.
    The single_prediction() explainer attributes parts of a model prediction to particular
    variables used in the model. It is a wrapper over 'breakDown' package (Staniak and
    Biecek 2018) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-072>. The variable_dropout() explainer calculates
    variable importance scores based on variable shuffling  (Fisher at al. 2018) <arXiv:1801.01489>.
    All these explainers can be plotted with generic plot() function and compared across
    different models. 'DALEX' is a part of the 'DrWhy.AI' universe (Biecek 2018) <arXiv:1806.08915>.
