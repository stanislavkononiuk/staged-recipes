  summary: 'A library for Forward Error Correction'
  description: |
    libcorrect is a library for Forward Error Correction. By using libcorrect,
    you can encode extra redundancy into a packet of data and then send it
    across a lossy channel. When the packet is received, it can be decoded to
    recover the original, pre-encoded data.

    libcorrect accomplishes this task with two algorithms, Convolutional codes
    and Reed-Solomon. Convolutional codes are robust to a constant background
    noise, while Reed-Solomon error correction is effective at dealing with
    noise that occurs in bursts. These algorithms have played an important role
    in telecommunications. libcorrect uses a Viterbi algorithm decoder to
    decode convolutional codes.

    libcorrect should be a drop-in, BSD-licensed substitute for libfec, which
    offers similar functionality under the LGPL-license.
