  summary: 'Force-delete a file or folder held by other Windows processes'
  description: |
    This can be used in race condition situations where a process has opened a
    folder and it tries to delete it just before closing the original handle.
    This function will close all the handles of all the processes that have
    opened the requested file or directory, thus it may cause unexpected
    behavior on other programs or could leave your file system on an
    inconsistent state. USE THIS UNDER YOUR OWN RISK.
