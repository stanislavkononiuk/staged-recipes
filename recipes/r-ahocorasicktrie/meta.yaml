  summary: Aho-Corasick is an optimal algorithm for finding many keywords in a text. It can locate
    all matches in a text in O(N+M) time; i.e., the time needed scales linearly with
    the number of keywords (N) and the size of the text (M). Compare this to the naive
    approach which takes O(N*M) time to loop through each pattern and scan for it in
    the text. This implementation builds the trie (the generic name of the data structure)
    and runs the search in a single function call. If you want to search multiple texts
    with the same trie, the function will take a list or vector of texts and return
    a list of matches to each text. By default, all 128 ASCII characters are allowed
    in both the keywords and the text. A more efficient trie is possible if the alphabet
    size can be reduced. For example, DNA sequences use at most 19 distinct characters
    and usually only 4; protein sequences use at most 26 distinct characters and usually
    only 20. UTF-8 (Unicode) matching is not currently supported.
