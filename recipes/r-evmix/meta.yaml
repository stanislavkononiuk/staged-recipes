  summary: The usual distribution functions, maximum likelihood inference and model diagnostics
    for univariate stationary extreme value mixture models are provided. Kernel density
    estimation including various boundary corrected kernel density estimation methods
    and a wide choice of kernels, with cross-validation likelihood based bandwidth estimator.
    Reasonable consistency with the base functions in the 'evd' package is provided,
    so that users can safely interchange most code.
