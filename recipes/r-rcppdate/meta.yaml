  summary: '''date'' is a C++ header library offering extensive date and time functionality for
    the C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards written by Howard Hinnant and released under
    the MIT license. A slightly modified version has been accepted (along with ''tz.h'')
    as part of C++20. This package regroups all header files from the upstream repository
    by Howard Hinnant so that other R packages can use them in their C++ code. At present,
    few of the types have explicit ''Rcpp'' wrapper though these may be added as needed.'
