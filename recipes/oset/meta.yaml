  summary: Ordered Set.
  description: "oset\n=====\n\nSet that remembers original insertion order.\n\nRuns on Py2.5 or later (and runs on 3.0 or later without any modifications). For Python2.5, a local backport of ABC classes\
    \ is also used.\n\nImplementation based on a doubly linked link and an internal dictionary. This design gives OrderedSet the same big-Oh running times as regular sets including O(1) adds, removes, and\
    \ lookups as well as O(n) iteration.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nImport and create ordered set.\n::\n\n    >>> from oset import oset\n    >>> os = oset()\n\nRequires\n-------- \n\n- Python 2.5+\n\nChanges\n\
