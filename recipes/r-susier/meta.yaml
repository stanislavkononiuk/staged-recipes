  summary: Implements methods for variable selection in linear regression based on the "Sum of
    Single Effects" (SuSiE) model, as described in Wang et al (2020) <DOI:10.1101/501114>.
    These methods provide simple summaries, called "Credible Sets", for accurately quantifying
    uncertainty in which variables should be selected. The methods are motivated by
    genetic fine-mapping applications, and are particularly well-suited to settings
    where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse. The fitting
    algorithm, a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods called "Iterative Bayesian
    Stepwise Selection" (IBSS), is simple and fast, allowing the SuSiE model be fit
    to large data sets (thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of variables).
