  summary: 'Django email backends and webhooks for Mailgun, Mailjet, Postmark, SendGrid, SparkPost and more '
  description: |
    Anymail integrates several transactional email service providers (ESPs) into Django, with a consistent API that lets you use ESP-added features without locking your code to a particular ESP.
    It currently fully supports Mailgun, Mailjet, Postmark, SendGrid, and SparkPost, and has limited support for Mandrill.
