    description: |
        Geant4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through
        matter. Its areas of application include high energy, nuclear and
        accelerator physics, as well as studies in medical and space science. The
        three main reference papers for Geant4 are published in Nuclear Instruments
        and Methods in Physics Research [A 506 (2003) 250-303](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900203013688),
