  description: |
     It is intended to be used by developers to facilitate the production of
     applications that communicate with USB hardware.

     It is portable: Using a single cross-platform API, it provides access to
     USB devices on Linux, OS X, Windows, Android, OpenBSD, etc.

     It is user-mode: No special privilege or elevation is required for the
     application to communicate with a device.

     It is version-agnostic: All versions of the USB protocol, from 1.0 to 3.1
     (latest), are supported.
