  summary: Manage the life cycle of your exported functions with shared conventions, documentation
    badges, and non-invasive deprecation warnings. The 'lifecycle' package defines four
    development stages (experimental, maturing, stable, and questioning) and three deprecation
    stages (soft-deprecated, deprecated, and defunct). It makes it easy to insert badges
    corresponding to these stages in your documentation. Usage of deprecated functions
    are signalled with increasing levels of non-invasive verbosity.
