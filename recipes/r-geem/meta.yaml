  summary: GEE estimation of the parameters in mean structures with possible correlation between
    the outcomes. User-specified mean link and variance functions are allowed, along
    with observation weighting. The 'M' in the name 'geeM' is meant to emphasize the
    use of the Matrix package, which allows for an implementation based fully in R.
