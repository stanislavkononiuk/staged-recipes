  summary: The popular population genetic software 'Treemix' by 'Pickrell and Pritchard' (2012)
    <DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1002967> estimates the number of migration edges on a
    population tree. However, it can be difficult to determine the number of migration
    edges to include. Previously, it was customary to stop adding migration edges when
    99.8% of variation in the data was explained, but 'OptM' automates this process
    using an ad hoc statistic based on the second-order rate of change in the log likelihood.  'OptM'
    also has added functionality for various threshold modeling to compare with the
    ad hoc statistic.
