  summary: Time series forecasting with PyTorch
  description: |
    Time series data modeling has broad significance in public health, finance, and engineering.
    Traditional time series methods from statistics often rely on strong modeling assumptions
    or are computationally expensive. Given the rise of large-scale sensing data and significant
    advances in deep learning, the goal of TorchTS is to provide an efficient and user-friendly
    deep learning library for time series that benefits the entire research community and beyond.
