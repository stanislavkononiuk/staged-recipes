  summary: Fit and compare complex models reliably and rapidly. Advanced Nested Sampling.

  description: |
    Fit and compare models very quickly. MCMC-free.
    
    Yes!
    
    Tailored for low-dimensional (d<10) problems with a single mode, this package automatically finds the best fit and uses the local covariance matrix as a Laplace Approximation. Then Importance Sampling and Variational Bayes come in to improve from a single-gaussian approximation to more complex shapes. This allows sampling efficiently in some problems, and provides a estimate for the marginal likelihood.
    
    This package is built on top the excellent (i)minuit and pypmc packages.
