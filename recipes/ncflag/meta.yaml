  summary: 'Interface for binary flags in data.'
  description: |
    ncflag is an interface for binary flag vectors in data. For example,
    ommonly used for quality flags. A set of
    compatible binary flag vectors are associated with flag_meanings, 
    flag_values, and possibly flag_masks metadata. These flags are 
    described in the CF-Conventions 
    http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html#flags
    The library is oriented towards netCDF data files, but could be 
    used in other contexts as well.
