  summary: 'Universally Unique Identifier'
  description: |
    UIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood of uniqueness 
    over space and time and are computationally difficult to guess. They are globally unique 
    identifiers which can be locally generated without contacting a global registration authority. 
    UUIDs are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects with an extremely 
    short lifetime and to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.
