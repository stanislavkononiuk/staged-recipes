  summary: 'Management of HPC clusters on Amazon Web Services using CloudFormation'

  description: |
    CfnCluster (“cloud formation cluster”) is a framework that deploys and maintains high performance computing clusters on
    Amazon Web Services (AWS). Developed by AWS, CfnCluster facilitates both quick start proof of concepts (POCs) and
    production deployments. CfnCluster supports many different types of clustered applications and can easily be extended to
    support different frameworks. Download CfnCluster today to see how CfnCluster’s command line interface leverages AWS
    CloudFormation templates and other AWS cloud services.
