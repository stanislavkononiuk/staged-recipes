  summary: 'A tool for the construction of interaction models'

  description: |
    atomicrex is a versatile tool for the construction of advanced 
    atomistic models. It is written in C++ and python. It was primarily 
    developed to fit interatomic potential models. Thanks to its 
    flexible generic structure its application range, however, is much 
    larger.
