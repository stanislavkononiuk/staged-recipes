  summary: 'Python client to WeedFS'

  description: |
    SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There
    are two objectives: to store billions of files! to serve the files fast!
    Instead of supporting full POSIX file system semantics, SeaweedFS choose to
    implement only a key~file mapping. Similar to the word "NoSQL", you can
    call it as "NoFS".
