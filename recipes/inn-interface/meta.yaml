  summary: 'Invertible neural network (INN) interface for WISDEM'
  description: |
    This software contains the invertible neural network (INN) 
    model for airfoil design and the high-level API to interface 
    with the Wind-Plant Integrated System Design and Engineering 
    odel (WISDEM). Individually, the model can generate new 
    airfoil shapes with desired performance characteristics. 
    Coupled with WISDEM, the software enables full 3D blade 
    design that consider aerodynamics, structural requirements, 
    and cost.
