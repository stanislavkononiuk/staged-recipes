  description: |
    HealSparse is a sparse implementation of HEALPix in Python.
    HealSparse is a pure Python library that sits on top of
    numpy and healpy and is designed to avoid storing full
    sky maps in case of partial coverage, including easy
    reading of sub-maps. This reduces the overall memory
    footprint allowing maps to be rendered at arcsecond
    resolution while keeping the familiarity and power of
    healpy.
