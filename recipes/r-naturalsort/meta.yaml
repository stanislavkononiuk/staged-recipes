  summary: Provides functions related to human natural ordering. It handles adjacent digits in
    a character sequence as a number so that natural sort function arranges a character
    vector by their numbers, not digit characters. It is typically seen when operating
    systems lists file names. For example, a sequence a-1.png, a-2.png, a-10.png looks
    naturally ordered because 1 < 2 < 10 and natural sort algorithm arranges so whereas
    general sort algorithms arrange it into a-1.png, a-10.png, a-2.png owing to their
    third and fourth characters.
