  summary: 'library for building and steering binned template fits'

  description: |
    cabinetry is a Python library for building and steering binned template fits. 
    It is written with applications in High Energy Physics in mind. 
    cabinetry interfaces many other powerful libraries to make it easy for an analyzer to run their statistical inference pipeline.
    Statistical models in HistFactory format can be built by cabinetry from instructions in a declarative configuration. 
    cabinetry makes heavy use of pyhf for statistical inference, and provides additional utilities to help study and disseminate fit results. 
    This includes commonly used visualizations. Due to its modular approach, analyzers are free to use all of cabinetry's functionality or only some pieces.
    cabinetry can be used for inference and visualization with any pyhf-compatible model, whether it was built with cabinetry or not.
