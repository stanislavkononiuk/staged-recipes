  summary: Sending functions to remote processes can be wasteful of resources because they carry
    their environments with them. With the carrier package, it is easy to create functions
    that are isolated from their environment. These isolated functions, also called
    crates, print at the console with their total size and can be easily tested locally
    before being sent to a remote.
