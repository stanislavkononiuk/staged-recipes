  summary: 'Provides several direct search optimization algorithms based on the simplex method.
    The provided algorithms are direct search algorithms, i.e. algorithms which do not
    use the derivative of the cost function. They are based on the update of a simplex.
    The following algorithms are available: the fixed shape simplex method of Spendley,
    Hext and Himsworth (unconstrained optimization with a fixed shape simplex), the
    variable shape simplex method of Nelder and Mead (unconstrained optimization with
    a variable shape simplex made), and Box''s complex method (constrained optimization
    with a variable shape simplex).'
