  summary: Fail tests that take too long to run
  description: |
    `pytest-fail-slow` is a pytest plugin for making tests fail that take too
    long to run.  It adds a `--fail-slow DURATION` command-line option to
    pytest that causes any & all otherwise-passing tests that run for longer
    than the given duration to be marked as failures, and it adds a
    `@pytest.mark.fail_slow(DURATION)` marker for making an individual test
    fail if it runs for longer than the given duration.  If `--fail-slow` is
    given and a test has the `@fail_slow()` marker, the duration given by the
    marker takes precedence for that test.
