  summary: "Fastpath is a fast and lightweight tool for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph"
  description: |
          Fastpath is a fast and lightweight tool for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
          As input it only needs the starting node, the ending node, and the weights of each node
          to node edge. For versatility it uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which allows for negative
          weights. Future version will incorporate the Dijkstra algorithm to speed up runtimes on 
          graphs that do not contain negative edges.
