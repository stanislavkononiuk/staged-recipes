  summary: 'Wrapper for easy dataset access (used in Best of ACRV codebases)'
  description: |
    The ACRV Datasets package is a light wrapper for generically managing
    datasets. The package supports any dataset, as long as it has a public URL.
    We emphasise that we do not own the datasets accessed through this package,
    we simply provide easy access and integration for projects like the Best of
    ACRV codebases (see https://roboticvision.org/best-of-acrv).
