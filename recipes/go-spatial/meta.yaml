  summary: 'GoSpatial is a command-line interface program  written in Go for analyzing and manipulating geospatial data written in Go'
  description: |
    GoSpatial is a command-line interface program for analyzing and manipulating geospatial data.
    It has been developed by John Lindsay using the Go programming language and is compiled to
    native code. The project is experimental and is intended to provide additional analytical
    support for the Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools open-source GIS software. GoSpatial
    can however be run completely independent of any other software.
