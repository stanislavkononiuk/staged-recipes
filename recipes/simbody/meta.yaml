    features:
        - vc14    # [win and py35]

# NOTE: This installs the minimum dependencies for Simbody, i.e., no
# visualizer. I'm also not completely sure if blas and lapack are necessary for
# the unix builds because they are supposedly included with Simbody. Once
# FreeGLUT, Xi, and Xmu are avaliable via Anaconda.org (free or conda-forge)
# they can be added.
requirements:
    build:
        - toolchain  # [unix]
        - cmake
        - blas       # [not win]
        - lapack     # [not win]
        - python     # [win]
    run:
        - blas    # [not win]
        - lapack  # [not win]
        - python  # [win]
test:
  requires:
    - python 3.5.*  # [win and py35]
  commands:
    - if not exist %LIBRARY_INC%\\Simbody.h exit 1  # [win]
    - test -f $PREFIX/include/Simbody.h             # [unix]
