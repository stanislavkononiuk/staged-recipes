# NOTE: This installs the minimum dependencies for Simbody on Windows and OSX,
# i.e., no visualizer, and all of the optional dependencies on Linux, i.e.
# include the visualizer. blas is the only required dependency, as it will
# install openblas which also includes lapack. blas is not needed for Windows
# because Simbody includes blas/lapack for the Windows builds. FreeGLUT is
# available via anaconda.org and conda-forge but libXi and libXmu are not, so
# the user will need those to be install via their Linux package manager.
