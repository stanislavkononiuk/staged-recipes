        - blas_{{ variant }}  # [unix]

# NOTE: This installs the minimum dependencies for Simbody, i.e., no
# visualizer. blas is the only required dependency, as it will install openblas
# which also includes lapack. blas is not needed for Windows because Simbody
# includes blas/lapack for the Windows builds.
# TODO: Once FreeGLUT, Xi, and Xmu are all avaliable via Anaconda.org (free or
# conda-forge) they can be added and the visualizer can be built on the unix
# os's.
