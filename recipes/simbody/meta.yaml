# NOTE: This installs Simbody and the optional visualizer on Linux, Windows, and
# OSX. We build against the openblas available in conda-forge which includes
# lapack on Linux and OSX. blas and lapack are not needed on Windows because
# Simbody includes them. For the visualizer, FreeGLUT is available via
# anaconda.org and conda-forge but libXi and libXmu are not, so the user will
# need those to be installed via their Linux package manager. Glut is included
# with Simbody for Windows and OSX includes a Glut implementation. TODO:
# Doxygen is the only dependency that is omitted here, so the rendered
# documentation is not built.
