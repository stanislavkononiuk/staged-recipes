  summary: 'An open source server project offering hydrological modeling and analysis capabilities through the Web Processing Service (WPS) standard'
  description: |
    Raven is a server providing access to hydrological modeling and analysis
    through the Web Processing Service (WPS) standard. It was made to help
    hydrologists work with climate data and automate some of the tedious work
    required to calibrate and run hydrological models. Its modeling engine is
    the Raven hydrological modeling framework, which can emulate a variety of
    lumped and distributed models.
