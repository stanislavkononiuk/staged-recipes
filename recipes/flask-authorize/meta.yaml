  summary: Flask plugin for content authorization and access control
  description: |
    Flask-Authorize is a Flask extension designed to simplify the process of
    incorporating Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into
    applications housing sensitive data, allowing developers to focus on the actual code
    for their application instead of logic for enforcing permissions. It uses a
    unix-like permissions scheme for enforcing access permissions on existing content,
    and also provides mechanisms for globally enforcing permissions throughout an
    application.
