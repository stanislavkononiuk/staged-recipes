  summary: Nose extends unittest to make testing easier
  description: |
    NOTE: Nose has been in maintenance mode for the past several years and will
    likely cease without a new person/team to take over maintainership. New
    projects should consider using Nose2, py.test, or just plain
    unittest/unittest2.
