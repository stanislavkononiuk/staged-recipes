  summary: 'Falcon Middleware: Require HTTPS'
  description: |
    The ``falcon-require-https`` package provides a middleware component for
    sanity-checking that the incoming request was received over HTTPS. While
    the web server is primarily responsibile for enforcing the HTTPS protocol,
    misconfiguration is still a leading cause of security vulnerabilities, and
    so it can be helpful to perform certain additional checks, such as this
    one, within the application layer itself.
