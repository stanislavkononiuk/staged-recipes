    # jq is special - it is needed for the pin-it utility in this package

    # build-like dependencies
    # As part of our scons build process, we do run tests, so
    # these really are required to perform a build.
    # Note that "testing" in conda-forge should be limited to testing 
    # successful packaging, and not testing code.
