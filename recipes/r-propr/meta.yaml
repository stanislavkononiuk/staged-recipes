  summary: The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with correlation-based
    analyses. However, correlation lacks validity when applied to relative data, including
    count data generated by next-generation sequencing. This package implements several
    metrics for proportionality, including phi [Lovell et al (2015) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075>]
    and rho [Erb and Notredame (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8>]. This package
    also implements several metrics for differential proportionality. Unlike correlation,
    these measures give the same result for both relative and absolute data.
