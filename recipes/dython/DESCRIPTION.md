# Dython

A set of **D**ata analysis tools in p**YTHON** 3.x.

**Key features:**
* Measures of association for categorical features
* Plot features correlation and association for mixed data-sets (categorical and continuous features) 
in an easy and simple way
* Plot ROC curves with AUC scores and estimated-optimal thresholds 

Dython was designed with analysis usage in mind - meaning ease-of-use, functionality and readability are the core 
values of this library. Production-grade performance, on the other hand, were not considered.
