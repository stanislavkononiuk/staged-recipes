    summary: 'mlpack a fast, flexible machine learning library'
    description: |
      mlpack is an intuitive, fast, and flexible C++ machine learning library 
      with bindings to other languages. It is meant to be a machine learning analog 
      to LAPACK, and aims to implement a wide array of machine learning methods and 
      functions as a "swiss army knife" for machine learning researchers. In addition 
      to its powerful C++ interface, mlpack also provides command-line programs and 
      Python bindings.
