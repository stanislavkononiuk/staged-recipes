  summary: 'Adjustment of geodetic networks'
  description: |
    GNU Gama is a project dedicated to adjustment of geodetic networks.
    It is intended for use with traditional geodetic surveyings which are
    still used and needed in special measurements (e.g., underground or
    high precision engineering measurements) where the Global Positioning
    System (GPS) cannot be used.
