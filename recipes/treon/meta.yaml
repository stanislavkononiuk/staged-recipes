  description: |
    Treon allows you to run notebook top to bottom and flags execution errors.
     It runs all unittests and doctests present in your notebook code cells. You
     can start testing notebooks without writing a single line of test code.
     Treon also enable multithreaded execution for quickly testing a set of
     notebooks. It executes every Notebook in a fresh kernel to avoid hidden
     state problems. Because treon is a command line tool itcan be used easily
     in any Continuous Integration (CI) system.
