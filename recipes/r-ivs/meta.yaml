  summary: 'Provides a library for generic interval manipulations using a new interval vector
    class. Capabilities include: locating various kinds of relationships between two
    interval vectors, merging overlaps within a single interval vector, splitting an
    interval vector on its overlapping endpoints, and applying set theoretical operations
    on interval vectors. Many of the operations in this package were inspired by James
    Allen''s interval algebra, Allen (1983) <doi:10.1145/182.358434>.'
