  summary: 'Extension for Sphinx to make the sidebar show a full table of contents instead of just the local headings'
  description: |
    sphinxcontrib-fulltoc is an extension for the Sphinx documentation
    system that changes the HTML output to include a more detailed
    table of contents in the sidebar. By default Sphinx only shows
    the local headers for the current page. With the extension installed,
    all of the page titles are included, and the local headers for the
    current page are also included in the appropriate place within the document.
