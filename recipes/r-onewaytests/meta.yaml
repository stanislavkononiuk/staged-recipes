  summary: Performs one-way tests in independent groups designs including homoscedastic and heteroscedastic
    tests. These are one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Welch's heteroscedastic F
    test, Welch's heteroscedastic F test with trimmed means and Winsorized variances,
    Brown-Forsythe test, Alexander-Govern test, James second order test, Kruskal-Wallis
    test, Scott-Smith test, Box F test and Johansen F test, Generalized tests equivalent
    to Parametric Bootstrap and Fiducial tests. The package performs pairwise comparisons
    and graphical approaches. Also, the package includes Student's t test, Welch's t
    test and Mann-Whitney U test for two samples. Moreover, it assesses variance homogeneity
    and normality of data in each group via tests and plots (Dag et al., 2018, <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-022/RJ-2018-022.pdf>).
