# WARNING: this source doesn't include the Catch submodule, which is used for
#          the test commands. It's not used for the examples, and we can just
#          ignore it there.

  # NOTE: rxcpp is header-only, but we still need the vc version dance because
  #       the build system doesn't work on vc9. Not sure if the actual library
  #       works or not.
