  summary: The advanced version of package 's2dverification'. It is intended for 'seasonal to
    decadal' (s2d) climate forecast verification, but it can also be used in other kinds
    of forecasts or general climate analysis. This package is specially designed for
    the comparison between the experimental and observational datasets. The functionality
    of the included functions covers from data retrieval, data post-processing, skill
    scores against observation, to visualization. Compared to 's2dverification', 's2dv'
    is more compatible with the package 'startR', able to use multiple cores for computation
    and handle multi-dimensional arrays with a higher flexibility.
