  summary: 'The open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits'
  description: |
    ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits.
    
    Such a circuit may comprise of JFETs, bipolar and MOS transistors, passive elements
    like R, L, or C, diodes, transmission lines and other devices, all interconnected
    in a netlist. Digital circuits are simulated as well, event driven and fast, from
    single gates to complex circuits. And you may enter the combination of both analog
    and digital as a mixed-signal circuit.
    
    ngspice offers a wealth of device models for active, passive, analog, and digital
    elements. Model parameters are provided by the semiconductor manufacturers.
    The user add her circuits as a netlist, and the output is one or more graphs of
    currents, voltages and other electrical quantities or is saved in a data file.
