  summary: 'Lightweight in-process concurrent programming'

  description: |
    The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython that
    supports micro-threads called "tasklets". Tasklets run pseudo-concurrently
    (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized with
    data exchanges on "channels".

    A "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of
    micro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words. This
    is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs. You can
    build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet; however, it seems
    that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to make advanced control
    flow structures. For example, we can recreate generators; the difference
    with Python's own generators is that our generators can call nested
    functions and the nested functions can yield values too. Additionally,
    you don't need a "yield" keyword. See the example in
    tests/test_generator.py.

    Greenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodified
    interpreter.

    Greenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent programming.
