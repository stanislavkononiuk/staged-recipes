  summary: |
    A modern, C++-native, header-only, test framework for unit-tests, TDD and BDD - using 
    C++11, C++14, C++17 and later (or C++03 on the Catch1.x branch).
  description: |
    Catch2 stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in a Header and is a multi-paradigm test framework 
    for C++. which also supports Objective-C (and maybe C). It is primarily distributed as a single 
    header file, although certain extensions may require additional headers.
