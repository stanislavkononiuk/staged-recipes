  summary: A package to help perform command-line image examination and plotting
  description: |
    imexam is an affiliated package of AstroPy. It was designed to be a
    lightweight library which enables users to explore data from a command
    line interface, through a Jupyter notebook or through a Jupyter console.
    It can be used with multiple viewers, such as DS9 or Ginga, or without a
    viewer as a simple library to make plots and grab quick photometry
    information. It has been designed so that other viewers may be easily
    attached in the future.
