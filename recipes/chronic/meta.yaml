  summary: 'Half profiler, half timer, 100% fun.'
  description: |
    Chronic is halfway between a simple timer and a profiler. Add 
    decorators or wrap code in with statements to get the execution time. 
    Chronic keeps track of the call hierarchy to tell you what timed 
    blocks executed within other timed blocks. Attach an event listener 
    to log your timings however you want.
