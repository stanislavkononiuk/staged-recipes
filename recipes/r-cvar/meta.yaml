  summary: Compute expected shortfall (ES) and Value at Risk (VaR) from a quantile function,
    distribution function, random number generator or probability density function.  ES
    is also known as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Virtually any continuous distribution
    can be specified. The functions are vectorized over the arguments. The computations
    are done directly from the definitions, see e.g. Acerbi and Tasche (2002) <doi:10.1111/1468-0300.00091>.
    Some support for GARCH models is provided, as well.
