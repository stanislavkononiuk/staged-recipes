  summary: Offers the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) test for set-based inference in genetic association
    studies. The GBJ is designed as an alternative to tests such as Berk-Jones (BJ),
    Higher Criticism (HC), Generalized Higher Criticism (GHC), Minimum p-value (minP),
    and Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT). All of these other methods (except
    for SKAT) are also implemented in this package, and we additionally provide an omnibus
    test (OMNI) which integrates information from each of the tests. The GBJ has been
    shown to outperform other tests in genetic association studies when signals are
    correlated and moderately sparse. Please see the vignette for a quickstart guide
    or the paper at <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1660170> for full details.
