  summary: This package provide functions for box-constrained multiobjective optimization using
    the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - NSGA-II. Fast non-dominated
    sorting, crowding distance, tournament selection, simulated binary crossover, and
    polynomial mutation are called in the main program, nsga2R, to complete the search.
