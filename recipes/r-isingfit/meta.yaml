  summary: This network estimation procedure eLasso, which is based on the Ising model, combines
    l1-regularized logistic regression with model selection based on the Extended Bayesian
    Information Criterion (EBIC). EBIC is a fit measure that identifies relevant relationships
    between variables. The resulting network consists of variables as nodes and relevant
    relationships as edges. Can deal with binary data.
