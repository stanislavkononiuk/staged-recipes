  summary: The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS) is a library containing many standard
    implementations of neural networks. This package wraps the SNNS functionality to
    make it available from within R. Using the 'RSNNS' low-level interface, all of the
    algorithmic functionality and flexibility of SNNS can be accessed. Furthermore,
    the package contains a convenient high-level interface, so that the most common
    neural network topologies and learning algorithms integrate seamlessly into R.
