  summary: 'Fast Exact Summation Using Small and Large Superaccumulators (XSUM)'
  description: |
    Fast Exact Summation Using Small and Large Superaccumulators (XSUM).
    XSUM is a library for performing exact summation using super-accumulators. 
    It provides methods for exactly summing a set of floating-point numbers, 
    where using a simple summation and the rounding which happens after each 
    addition could be an important factor in many applications.
    The main algorithm is taken from the original library 
    [FUNCTIONS FOR EXACT SUMMATION](https://gitlab.com/radfordneal/xsum) 
    described in the paper 
    "Fast Exact Summation Using Small and Large Superaccumulators," by Radford 
    M. Neal.
