  summary: "A friend to fetch your Python library's sample data files"
  description: |
    Pooch will manage downloading your sample data files over HTTP from a server and
    storing them in a local directory. (1) Download a file only if it's not in the local
    storage. (2) Check the SHA256 hash to make sure the file is not corrupted or needs
    updating. (3) If the hash is different from the registry, Pooch will download a new
    version of the file. (4) If the hash still doesn't match, Pooch will raise an
    exception warning of possible data corruption.
