  summary: 'Tooling to group dates by a variety of periods including: yearly, monthly, by second,
    by week of the month, and more. The groups are defined in such a way that they also
    represent the distance between dates in terms of the period. This extracts valuable
    information that can be used in further calculations that rely on a specific temporal
    spacing between observations.'
