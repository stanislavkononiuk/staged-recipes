  summary: 'Functions related to multivariate measures of independence and ICA: -estimate independent
    components by minimizing distance covariance; -conduct a test of mutual independence
    based on distance covariance; -estimate independent components via infomax (a popular
    method but generally performs poorer than mdcovica, ProDenICA, and/or fastICA, but
    is useful for comparisons); -order indepedent components by skewness; -match independent
    components from multiple estimates; -other functions useful in ICA.'
