  summary: Computation of the alpha-shape and alpha-convex hull of a given sample of points in
    the plane. The concepts of alpha-shape and alpha-convex hull generalize the definition
    of the convex hull of a finite set of points. The programming is based on the duality
    between the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation. The package also includes
    a function that returns the Delaunay mesh of a given sample of points and its dual
    Voronoi diagram in one single object.
