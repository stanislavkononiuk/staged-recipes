  summary: 'Sonnet is a library built on top of TensorFlow 2 designed to provide simple, composable abstractions for machine learning research.'
  description: |
    Sonnet has been designed and built by researchers at DeepMind. 
    It can be used to construct neural networks for many different 
    purposes (un/supervised learning, reinforcement learning, ...).
    More specifically, Sonnet provides a simple but powerful programming 
    model centered around a single concept: snt.Module. Modules can hold 
    references to parameters, other modules and methods that apply some 
    function on the user input. Sonnet ships with many predefined modules 
    (e.g. snt.Linear, snt.Conv2D, snt.BatchNorm) and some predefined networks 
    of modules (e.g. snt.nets.MLP) but users are also encouraged to build their 
    own modules.
