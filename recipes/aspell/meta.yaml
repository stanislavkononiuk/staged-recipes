  summary: 'GNU Aspell is a Free and Open Source spell checker'
  description: |
    GNU Aspell is a Free and Open Source spell checker designed to eventually
    replace Ispell. It can either be used as a library or as an independent
    spell checker. Its main feature is that it does a superior job of
    suggesting possible replacements for a misspelled word than just about any
    other spell checker out there for the English language. Unlike Ispell,
    Aspell can also easily check documents in UTF-8 without having to use a
    special dictionary. Aspell will also do its best to respect the current
    locale setting. Other advantages over Ispell include support for using
    multiple dictionaries at once and intelligently handling personal
    dictionaries when more than one Aspell process is open at once.
