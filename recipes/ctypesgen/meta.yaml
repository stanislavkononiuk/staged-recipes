  summary: Python wrapper generator for ctypes
  description:
    ctypesgen reads parses c header files and creates a wrapper for
    libraries based on what it finds.
    Preprocessor macros are handled in a manner consistent with typical
    c code.
    Preprocessor macro functions are translated into Python functions
    that are then made available to the user of the newly-generated
    Python wrapper library.
    ctypesgen can also output JSON, which can be used with Mork, which
    generates bindings for Lua, using the alien module
    (which binds libffi to Lua).
