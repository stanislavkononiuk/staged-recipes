  summary: 'View flow data as Sankey diagrams'
  
  description: |
    Many kinds of data can be thought of as 'flows': energy and materials moving
    through industry, money flowing through the economy, telephone lines moving
    between providers, voters moving between parties. floWeaver helps you to
    exchange and analyse flow data and visualise it using Sankey diagrams.
