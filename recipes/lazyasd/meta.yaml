  summary: 'Lazy & self-destructive tools for speeding up module imports'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
    A package that provides lazy and self-destructive tools for speeding up module imports.
    This is useful whenever startup times are critical, such as for command line interfaces
    or other user-facing applications. The tools in this module implement two distinct
    strategies for speeding up module import. The first is delayed construction of global
    state and the second is to import expensive modules in a background thread.
