  summary: Qualitative methods for the validation of dynamic models. It contains (i) an orthogonal
    set of deviance measures for absolute, relative and ordinal scale and (ii) approaches
    accounting for time shifts. The first approach transforms time to take time delays
    and speed differences into account. The second divides the time series into interval
    units according to their main features and finds the longest common subsequence
    (LCS) using a dynamic programming algorithm.
