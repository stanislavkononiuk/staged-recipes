  # this patch is required for packages from the 'rios' channel
  # since I named the lib weirdly so it didn't conflict with Howard
  # Butler's lib of the same name which is now defunct. 
  # When the lastools package is accepted into conda-forge this will 
  # no longer be required as I changed the name back to liblas.
