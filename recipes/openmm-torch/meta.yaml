  summary: 'OpenMM plugin to define forces with neural networks'
  description: |
    This is a plugin for OpenMM that allows neural networks to be
    used for defining forces. It is implemented with PyTorch.
    To use it, you create a PyTorch model that takes particle
    positions as input and produces energy as output. This plugin
    uses the model to apply forces to particles during a simulation.
