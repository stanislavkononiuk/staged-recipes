  summary: Inverse normal transformation (INT) based genetic association testing. These tests
    are recommend for continuous traits with non-normally distributed residuals. INT-based
    tests robustly control the type I error in settings where standard linear regression
    does not, as when the residual distribution exhibits excess skew or kurtosis. Moreover,
    INT-based tests dominate standard linear regression in terms of power. These tests
    may be classified into two types. In direct INT (D-INT), the phenotype is itself
    transformed. In indirect INT (I-INT), phenotypic residuals are transformed. The
    omnibus test (O-INT) adaptively combines D-INT and I-INT into a single robust and
    statistically powerful approach. See McCaw ZR, Lane JM, Saxena R, Redline S, Lin
    X. "Operating characteristics of the rank-based inverse normal transformation for
    quantitative trait analysis in genome-wide association studies" <doi:10.1111/biom.13214>.
