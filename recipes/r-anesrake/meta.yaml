  summary: Provides a comprehensive system for selecting variables and weighting data to match
    the specifications of the American National Election Studies. The package includes
    methods for identifying discrepant variables, raking data, and assessing the effects
    of the raking algorithm. It also allows automated re-raking if target variables
    fall outside identified bounds and allows greater user specification than other
    available raking algorithms. A variety of simple weighted statistics that were previously
    in this package (version .55 and earlier) have been moved to the package 'weights.'
