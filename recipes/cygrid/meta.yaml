  summary: 'Cygrid is a cython-powered convolution-based gridding module for astronomy'
  description: |
      Cygrid allows to resample a number of spectra (or data points) to a
      regular grid - a data cube - using any valid astronomical FITS/WCS
      projection. The method is a based on serialized convolution with finite
      gridding kernels. Currently, only Gaussian (radial-symmetric or
      elliptical) kernels are provided (which has the drawback of slight
      degradation of the effective resolution). The algorithm has very small
      memory footprint, allows easy parallelization, and is very fast.
