  summary: Bundle a full playbook so you can run it as a single binary.
  description: |
    Ansible Bundler embeds together a full playbook and its dependencies so you
    can run it it from a single binary on any* computer, having just Python as
    a host dependency - you don't even need Ansible! Think of it as makeself
    for Ansible playbooks.
