  summary: Implements various procedures for finding  multiple change-points. Two methods make
    use of dynamic  programming and probabilistic pruning, with no distributional  assumptions
    other than the existence of certain absolute  moments in one method. Hierarchical
    and exact search methods  are included. All methods return the set of estimated
    change- points as well as other summary information.
