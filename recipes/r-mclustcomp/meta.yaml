  summary: Given a set of data points, a clustering is defined as a disjoint partition where
    each pair of sets in a partition has no overlapping elements. This package provides
    25 methods that play a role somewhat similar to distance or metric that measures
    similarity of two clusterings - or partitions. For a more detailed description,
    see Meila, M. (2005) <doi:10.1145/1102351.1102424>.
