  summary: 'A pure Python micro-framework supporting seamless lazy and concurrent evaluation of computation graphs.'
  description: |
    In essence, the package allows to write functional code directly in
    Python: statements merely specify relationships among variables
    through operations. Evaluation of any variable given the values of
    other variables is then de facto:
  
      * lazy: only operations participating in the determination of the requested value are executed,
      * concurrent: operations can be executed by a thread pool of arbitrary size.
    
    In addition, relationships among variables can be traversed in
    both directions, allowing a form of backpropagation of information
    through the computation network that would be cumbersome to
    implement in an imperative manner.
