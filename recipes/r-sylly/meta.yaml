  summary: Provides the hyphenation algorithm used for 'TeX'/'LaTeX' and similar software, as
    proposed by Liang (1983, <https://tug.org/docs/liang/>). Mainly contains the function
    hyphen() to be used for hyphenation/syllable counting of text objects. It was originally
    developed for and part of the 'koRpus' package, but later released as a separate
    package so it's lighter to have this particular functionality available for other
    packages. Support for various languages needs be added on-the-fly or by plugin packages
    (<https://undocumeantit.github.io/repos>); this package does not include any language
    specific data. Due to some restrictions on CRAN, the full package sources are only
    available from the project homepage. To ask for help, report bugs, request features,
