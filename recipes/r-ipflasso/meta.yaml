  summary: The core of the package is cvr2.ipflasso(), an extension of glmnet to be used when
    the (large) set of available predictors is partitioned into several modalities which
    potentially differ with respect to their information content in terms of prediction.
    For example, in biomedical applications patient outcome such as survival time or
    response to therapy may have to be predicted based on, say, mRNA data, miRNA data,
    methylation data, CNV data, clinical data, etc. The clinical predictors are on average
    often much more important for outcome prediction than the mRNA data. The ipflasso
    method takes this problem into account by using different penalty parameters for
    predictors from different modalities. The ratio between the different penalty parameters
    can be chosen by cross-validation.
