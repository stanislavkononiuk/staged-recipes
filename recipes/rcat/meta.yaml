  summary: 'Regional Climate Analysis Tool (RCAT)'

  description: |
    RCAT is an analysis tool primarily developed for analysis of regional
    climate models, but may also be used for global models as well. It's purely
    written in Python where we aim for a modular code in a functional style.
    The purpose is to get an efficient and structured way of collaboration
    within our model developers but also for non pythonists that want to use
    the tool for standard climate data analysis.
