  summary: We described a novel Topology-based pathway enrichment analysis, which integrated
    the global position of the nodes and the topological property of the pathways in  Kyoto
    Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Database. We also provide some functions to obtain
    the latest information about pathways to finish pathway enrichment analysis using
    this method.
