    Snzip is one of command line tools using snappy. This supports several file
    formats; framing-format, old framing-format, hadoop-snappy format, raw
    format and obsolete three formats used by snzip, snappy-java and
    snappy-in-java before official framing-format was defined. The default
    format is framing-format.
