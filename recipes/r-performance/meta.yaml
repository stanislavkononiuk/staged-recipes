  summary: Utilities for computing measures to assess model quality, which are not directly provided
    by R's 'base' or 'stats' packages. These  include e.g. measures like r-squared,
    intraclass correlation coefficient (Nakagawa, Johnson & Schielzeth (2017) <doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0213>),  root
    mean squared error or functions to check models for overdispersion,  singularity
    or zero-inflation and more. Functions apply to a large variety of regression models,
    including generalized linear models, mixed effects models and Bayesian models.
