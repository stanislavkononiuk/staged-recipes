  summary: Provides various themes, palettes, and other functions that are used to customise
    ggplots to look like they were made in 'GraphPad Prism'. The 'Prism'-look is achieved
    with theme_prism() and scale_fill|colour_prism(), axes can be changed with custom
    guides like guide_prism_minor(), and significance indicators added with add_pvalue().
