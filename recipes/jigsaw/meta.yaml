  summary: |
    JIGSAW is a Delaunay-based unstructured mesh generator for two- and
    three-dimensional geometries.
  description: |
    JIGSAW is a computational library for unstructured mesh generation and
    tessellation; designed to generate high-quality triangulations and
    polyhedral decompositions of general planar, surface and volumetric
    domains. JIGSAW includes refinement-based algorithms for the construction
    of new meshes, optimisation-driven techniques for the improvement of
    existing grids, as well as routines to assemble (restricted) Delaunay
    tessellations and Voronoi complexes.

    This package provides the underlying C++ source for JIGSAW; defining a
    basic command-line interface and a C-format API. A MATLAB / OCTAVE based
    scripting interface, including a range of additional facilities for file
    I/O, mesh visualisation and post-processing operations can be found at
    https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-matlab.
