  summary: Supports the definition of sets of properties on objects. Observers can listen to
    changes on individual properties or the set as a whole. The properties are meant
    to be fully self-describing. In support of this, there is a framework for defining
    enumerated types, as well as other bounded types, as S4 classes.
