  summary: "pseudo-random number generator library"
  description: "Tina's Random Number Generator Library (TRNG)
    is a state of the art C++ pseudo-random number generator library for
    sequential and parallel Monte Carlo simulations. Its design principles are
    based on a proposal for an extensible random number generator facility,
    that has become part of the C++11 standard.
    
    The TRNG library features an object oriented design, is easy to use and
    has been speed optimized. Its implementation does not depend on any
    communication library or hardware architecture. TRNG is suited for shared
    memory as well as for distributed memory computers and may be used in any
    parallel programming environment, e.g. Message Passing Standard, OpenMP or
    CUDA. All generators, that are implemented by TRNG, have been subjected to
    thorough statistical tests in sequential and parallel setups."
