  description: |
    EOmaps is a python library to simplify the creation of interactive
    maps (using only a pandas.DataFrame as input)!
    
    Many pre-defined callback functions are available to execute tasks
    (add annotations/markers, swipe layers etc.), when you click on the map.
    (custom callbacks are also supported!)
    
    Interfaces to several WebMap services are available that can be added 
    as base- or comparison-layers to the plot.
    
    Check the documentation for more details & examples!
