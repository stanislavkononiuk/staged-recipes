  summary: 'i-PI: a universal force engine'
  description: |
    i-PI is a universal force engine interface written in Python, designed
    to be used together with an ab-initio (or force-field based) 
    evaluation of the interactions between the atoms. The main goal is to
    decouple the problem of evolving the ionic positions to sample the
    appropriate thermodynamic ensemble and the problem of computing the
    inter-atomic forces.
