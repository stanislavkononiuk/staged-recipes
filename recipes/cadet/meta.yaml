  summary: 'Fast and accurate solver for extensive models'
  description: The CADET software is a fast and accurate solver for a comprehensive model family. Typical applications include (but are not limited to) chromatography, filtration, crystallization, and fermentation. CADET can handle arbitrary sequences and networks of unit operations, including reactors, tanks, tubes, pumps, valves, detectors, etc. The resulting models are solved with state-of-the-art mathematical algorithms and scientific computing techniques.
