  summary: |
    Create, read and write GEXF (Graph Exchange XML Format) graph files (used in Gephi
    and others). Using the XML package, it allows the user to easily build/read graph
    files including attributes, GEXF viz attributes (such as color, size, and position),
    network dynamics (for both edges and nodes) and edge weighting. Users can build/handle
    graphs element-by-element or massively through data-frames, visualize the graph
    on a web browser through "sigmajs" (a javascript library) and interact with the
    igraph package.
