  summary: 'Intake interface to STAC data catalogs'

  description: |
    This is an intake data source for STAC catalogs. The SpatioTemporal Asset
    Catalog (STAC) specification provides a common language to describe a
    range of geospatial information, so it can more easily be indexed and
    discovered. A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that represents
    information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.
