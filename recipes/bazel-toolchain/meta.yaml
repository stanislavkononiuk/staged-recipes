  summary: Helper script to generate a crosscompile toolchain for Bazel with the currently activated compiler settings.
  description: | 
    This package generates a crosstool toolchain for Bazel that uses the currently
    activated compilers / linker as defined by the environment variables. It does
    take various conda(-forge) specifics into account for this. In addition to generating
    a toolchain, it also sets various environment variables that need to be set for
    the toolchain to work. Especially you will need to pass in the correct ${TARGET_CPU}
    to ensure that cross-compiling also works.

    In build.sh

      source gen-bazel-toolchain
      bazel build --crosstool_top=//bazel_toolchain:toolchain --cpu ${TARGET_CPU} â€¦
