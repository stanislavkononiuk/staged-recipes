  summary: S3 functions implementing both statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit measures
    between observed and simulated values, mainly oriented to be used during the calibration,
    validation, and application of hydrological models. Missing values in observed and/or
    simulated values can be removed before computations. Comments / questions / collaboration
    of any kind are very welcomed.
