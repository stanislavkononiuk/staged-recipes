  summary: 'SnakeViz is a viewer for Python profiling data that runs as a web application in your browser.'

  description: |
    SnakeViz is a browser based graphical viewer for the output of Pythonâ€™s cProfile module. It was originally inspired
    by RunSnakeRun. SnakeViz works on Python 2.7 and Python 3. SnakeViz itself is still likely to work on Python 2.6,
    but official support has been dropped now that Tornado no longer supports Python 2.6.
