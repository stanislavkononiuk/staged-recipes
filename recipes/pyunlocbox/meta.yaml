  summary: 'A Python convex optimization package using proximal splitting methods'
  description: |
    The PyUNLocBoX is a convex optimization package based on proximal splitting
    methods and implemented in Python. The package is designed to be easy to
    use while allowing any advanced tasks. It is not meant to be a black-box
    optimization tool. You'll have to carefully design your solver. In exchange
    you'll get full control of what the package does for you, without the pain
    of rewriting the proximity operators and the solvers and with the added
    benefit of tested algorithms. With this package, you can focus on your
    problem and the best way to solve it rather that the details of the
    algorithms.
