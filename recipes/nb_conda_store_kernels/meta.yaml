  summary: "Launch Jupyter kernels from Conda-Store"
  description: |
    This extension enables a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
    application to access environments stored in Conda-Store and run
    kernels for Python, R, and other languages. When a kernel from an
    external environment is selected, the environment is downloaded,
    extracted, conda environment is automatically activated, and
    finally the kernel is launched. This package was heavily inspired
    by [nb_conda_kernels](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels).
