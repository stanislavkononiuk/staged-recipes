  summary: 'An IIS-Python bridge based on WSGI and FastCGI.'

  description: |
    wfastcgi.py provides a bridge between IIS and Python using WSGI and FastCGI, similar to 
    what mod_python provides for Apache HTTP Server.

    It can be used with any Python web application or framework that supports WSGI, and provides 
    an efficient way to handle requests and process pools through IIS.
