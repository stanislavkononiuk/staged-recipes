  summary: 'High quality MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3) decoder'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
    MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2
    extension to lower sampling frequencies, as well as the de facto MPEG 2.5 format.
    All three audio layers — Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III (i.e. MP3) — are fully implemented.
    MAD does not yet support MPEG-2 multichannel audio (although it should be
    backward compatible with such streams) nor does it currently support AAC.
