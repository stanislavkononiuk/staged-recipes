  summary: Provides a generic, publisher-independent Rmarkdown template for writing scientific
    papers and reports in Rmarkdown. The template allows for all the basic features
    of a scientific article, including a title page with author affiliations and footnotes
    possibly shown in two common formats, multi-language abstracts and keywords, page
    headers and footers, and the ability to place figures and tables at the end of the
    output PDF. Smart cross-referencing of figures, tables, equations and sections is
    provided using the bookdown package. See package README.md for basic package usage.
