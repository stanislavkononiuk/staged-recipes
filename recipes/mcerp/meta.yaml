  summary: Real-time latin-hypercube-sampling-based Monte Carlo Error Propagation
  description: |
    `mcerp` is a stochastic calculator for [Monte Carlo methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) that uses
    [latin-hypercube sampling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling)
    to perform non-order specific [error propagation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty)
    (or uncertainty analysis).

    With this package you can **easily** and **transparently** track the effects
    of uncertainty through mathematical calculations. Advanced mathematical
    functions, similar to those in the standard [`math`](http://docs.python.org/library/math.html)
    module, and statistical functions like those in the [`scipy.stats`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html)
    module, can also be evaluated directly.

    If you are familiar with Excel-based risk analysis programs like *@Risk*,
    *Crystal Ball*, *ModelRisk*, etc., this package **will work wonders** for you
    (and probably even be faster!) and give you more modelling flexibility with
    the powerful Python language. This package also *doesn't cost a penny*,
    compared to those commercial packages which cost *thousands of dollars* for a
    single-seat license. Feel free to copy and redistribute this package as much
    as you desire!
