  summary: 'A Python module for creation and manipulation of GDSII stream files'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    Gdspy is a Python module for creation and manipulation of GDSII stream
    files. Key features for the creation of complex CAD layouts are included:
    1. Boolean operations on polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) based on clipping
    algorithm; 2. Polygon offset (inward and outward rescaling of polygons);
    and 3. Efficient point-in-polygon solutions for large array sets.  Gdspy
    also includes a simple layout viewer.
