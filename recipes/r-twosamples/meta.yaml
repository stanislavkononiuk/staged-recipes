  summary: 'Fast randomization based two sample tests. Testing the hypothesis that two samples
    come from the same distribution using randomization to create p-values. Included
    tests are: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper, Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, Wasserstein,
    and DTS. The default test (two_sample) is based on the DTS test statistic, as it
    is the most powerful, and thus most useful to most users. The DTS test statistic
    builds on the Wasserstein distance by using a weighting scheme like that of Anderson-Darling.
    See the companion paper at <arXiv:2007.01360> or <https://codowd.com/public/DTS.pdf>
    for details of that test statistic, and non-standard uses of the package (parallel
    for big N, weighted observations, one sample tests, etc). We also include the permutation
    scheme to make test building simple for others.'
