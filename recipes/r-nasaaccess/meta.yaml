  summary: A tool to generate gridded ascii tables and station files needed by hydrological models
    for weather and climate inputs. The package assumes that users have already set
    up a registration account(s) with Earthdata login as well as authorizing NASA GES
    DISC data access. Please refer to  <https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access> for
    further details. The package relies on 'curl' <https://curl.se/> commands and library
    to access NASA remote sensing servers. Users should make sure that their local machines
    have 'curl' installed properly.  Instructions on creating the ".netrc" and ".urs_cookies"
    files can be accessed at <https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Access+Data+With+cURL+And+Wget>.
    Creating the ".netrc" file at the user machine 'Home' directory and storing the
    NASA GES DISC user logging information in it is needed to execute the package commands.
