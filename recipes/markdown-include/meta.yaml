about:
  home: https://github.com/cmacmackin/markdown-include/
  summary:  Provides syntax for Python-Markdown which allows for the inclusion of the contents of other Markdown documents. 
  description: |
  This is an extension to Python-Markdown which provides an "include" function,
  similar to that found in LaTeX (and also the C pre-processor and Fortran). I
  originally wrote it for my FORD Fortran auto-documentation generator.
