  summary: For one-way layout experiments the one-way ANOVA can be performed as an omnibus test.
    All-pairs multiple comparisons  tests (Tukey-Kramer test, Scheffe test, LSD-test)  and
    many-to-one tests (Dunnett test) for normally distributed  residuals and equal within
    variance are available. Furthermore, all-pairs tests (Games-Howell test, Tamhane's
    T2 test,  Dunnett T3 test, Ury-Wiggins-Hochberg test) and many-to-one (Tamhane-Dunnett
    Test) for normally distributed residuals  and heterogeneous variances are provided.
    Van der Waerden's normal scores test for omnibus, all-pairs and many-to-one tests
    is provided for non-normally distributed residuals and homogeneous variances. The
    Kruskal-Wallis, BWS and Anderson-Darling omnibus test and all-pairs tests (Nemenyi
    test, Dunn test, Conover test, Dwass-Steele-Critchlow- Fligner test) as well as
    many-to-one (Nemenyi test, Dunn test, U-test) are given for the analysis of variance
    by ranks.  Non-parametric trend tests (Jonckheere test, Cuzick test, Johnson-Mehrotra
    test, Spearman test) are included.  In addition, a Friedman-test for one-way ANOVA
    with repeated  measures on ranks (CRBD) and Skillings-Mack test for unbalanced  CRBD
    is provided with consequent all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test,  Siegel test, Miller
    test, Conover test, Exact test) and many-to-one tests (Nemenyi test, Demsar test,
    Exact test).  A trend can be tested with Pages's test. Durbin's test  for a two-way
    balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is given  in this package as well as Gore's
    test for CRBD with multiple observations per cell is given.  Outlier tests, Mandel's
    k- and h statistic as well as functions for Type I error and Power  analysis as
    well as generic summary, print and plot methods  are provided.
