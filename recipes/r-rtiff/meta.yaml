  summary: Reads and writes TIFF format images and returns them as a pixmap object. Because the
    resulting object can be very large for even modestly sized TIFF images, images can
    be reduced as they are read for improved performance.  This package is a wrapper
    around libtiff (www.libtiff.org), on which it depends (i.e. the libtiff shared library
    must be on your PATH for the binary to work, and tiffio.h must be on your system
    to build the package from source). By using libtiff's highlevel TIFFReadRGBAImage
    function, this package inherently supports a wide range of image formats and compression
    schemes. This package also provides an implementation of the Ridler Autothresholding
    algorithm for easy generation of binary masks as described in Ridler & Calvard (1978)
    <doi:10.1109/TSMC.1978.4310039>.
