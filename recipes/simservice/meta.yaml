  summary: 'A library for building simulation services in Python'
  description: |
    SimService is a library for building simulation services in Python.
    SimService is lightweight, written in pure Python and designed to generate
    memory-isolated, interactive proxy objects of simulations with minimal effort.
    SimService is especially designed to encapsulate stateful simulations,
    simulation libraries and frameworks for usage in general Python environments
    as interactive objects that can be integrated into larger computational workflows
    and interconnected in multi-method models and simulations. In support of simulation
    frameworks, SimService provides support for customizing the interface of service
    proxies at multiple levels of an underlying service, both statically in a service
    implementation, as well as dynamically in the specification of a simulation.
