  summary: 'Materials graph network with 3-body interactions featuring a DFT surrogate crystal relaxer and a state-of-the-art property predictor.'
  description: |
    M3GNet is a new materials graph neural network architecture that incorporates 3-body interactions. 
    A key difference with prior materials graph implementations is the addition of the coordinates for
    atoms and the 3Ã—3 lattice matrix in crystals, which are necessary for obtaining tensorial quantities
    such as forces and stresses via auto-differentiation.
