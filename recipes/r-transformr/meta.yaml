  summary: In order to smoothly animate the transformation of polygons and paths, many aspects
    needs to be taken into account, such as differing number of control points, changing
    center of rotation, etc. The 'transformr' package provides an extensive framework
    for manipulating the shapes of polygons and paths and can be seen as the spatial
    brother to the 'tweenr' package.
