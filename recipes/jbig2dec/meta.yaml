  summary: 'A decoder implementation of the JBIG2 image compression format'
  description: |
    JBIG2 is designed for lossy or lossless encoding of 'bilevel'
    (1-bit monochrome) images at moderately high resolution, and
    in particular, scanned paper documents. In this domain it can
    be very efficient, offering compression ratios on the order of
    100:1
