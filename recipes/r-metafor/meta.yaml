  summary: A comprehensive collection of functions for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package
    includes functions to calculate various effect sizes or outcome measures, fit fixed-,
    random-, and mixed-effects models to such data, carry out moderator and meta-regression
    analyses, and create various types of meta-analytical plots (e.g., forest, funnel,
    radial, L'Abbe, Baujat, GOSH plots). For meta-analyses of binomial and person-time
    data, the package also provides functions that implement specialized methods, including
    the Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's method, and a variety of suitable generalized
    linear (mixed-effects) models (i.e., mixed-effects logistic and Poisson regression
    models). Finally, the package provides functionality for fitting meta-analytic multivariate/multilevel
    models that account for non-independent sampling errors and/or true effects (e.g.,
    due to the inclusion of multiple treatment studies, multiple endpoints, or other
    forms of clustering). Network meta-analyses and meta-analyses accounting for known
    correlation structures (e.g., due to phylogenetic relatedness) can also be conducted.
