  summary: 'Derivative-Free Solver for Bound-Constrained Minimization'
  description: |
    Py-BOBYQA is a flexible package for solving bound-constrained general 
    objective minimization, without requiring derivatives of the objective. At 
    its core, it is a Python implementation of the BOBYQA algorithm by Powell, 
    but Py-BOBYQA has extra features improving its performance on some problems
    (see the papers below for details). Py-BOBYQA is particularly useful when 
    evaluations of the objective function are expensive and/or noisy.
