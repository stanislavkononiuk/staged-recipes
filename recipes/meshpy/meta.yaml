  summary: 'Triangular and Tetrahedral Mesh Generator'

  description: |

    MeshPy offers quality triangular and tetrahedral mesh generation for
    Python. Meshes of this type are chiefly used in finite-element
    simulation codes, but also have many other applications ranging from
    computer graphics to robotics.

    In order to generate 2D and 3D meshes, MeshPy provides Python interfaces
    to three well-regarded mesh generators,
    [Triangle](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) by J. Shewchuk,
    [TetGen](http://tetgen.berlios.de/) by Hang Si, and
    [gmsh](http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/) by Christophe Geuzaine and
    Jean-Francois Remacle. The former two are included in the package in
    slightly modified versions. A generic mesh reader for the latter is
    included, as is an easy way to run gmsh from a Python script.

    As of Version 0.91.2, MeshPy also works with Python 3.
