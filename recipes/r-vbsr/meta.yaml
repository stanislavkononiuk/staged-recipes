  summary: Efficient algorithm for solving ultra-sparse regularized regression models using a
    variational Bayes algorithm with a spike (l0) prior.  Algorithm is solved on a path,
    with coordinate updates, and is capable of generating very sparse models.  There
    are very general model diagnostics for controling type-1 error included in this
    package.
