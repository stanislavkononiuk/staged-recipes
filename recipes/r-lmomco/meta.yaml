  summary: 'Extensive functions for L-moments (LMs) and probability-weighted moments (PWMs),
    parameter estimation for distributions, LM computation for distributions, and L-moment
    ratio diagrams. Maximum likelihood and maximum product of spacings estimation are
    also available. LMs for right-tail and left-tail censoring by known or unknown threshold
    and by indicator variable are available. Asymmetric (asy) trimmed LMs (TL-moments,
    TLMs) are supported. LMs of residual (resid) and reversed (rev) resid life are implemented
    along with 13 quantile function operators for reliability and survival analyses.
    Exact analytical bootstrap estimates of order statistics, LMs, and variances- covariances
    of LMs are provided. The Harri-Coble Tau34-squared Normality Test is available.
