  summary: Geometry shapes in 'R' are typically represented by matrices (points, lines), with
    more complex shapes being lists of matrices (polygons). 'Geometries' will convert
    various 'R' objects into these shapes. Conversion functions are available at both
    the 'R' level, and through 'Rcpp'.
