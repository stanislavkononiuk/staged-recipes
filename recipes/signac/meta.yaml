  summary: 'Simple, extensible data management framework.'
  description: |
    The signac framework aids in the management of large and heterogeneous
    data spaces. It provides a simple and robust data model to create a
    well-defined indexable storage layout for data and metadata.
    This makes it easier to operate on large data spaces, streamlines
    post-processing and analysis and makes data collectively accessible.
    The implementation is in pure python and tested for versions 2.7.x and
    3.4+. There are no hard dependencies to allow painless transition into
    various environments, some extra features are available via optional
    dependencies.
