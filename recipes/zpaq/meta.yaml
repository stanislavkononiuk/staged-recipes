  summary: 'journaling archiver optimized for user-level incremental backup of directory trees'
  description: |
      zpaq is a journaling archiver optimized for user-level incremental
      backup of directory trees in Windows and *nix. It supports AES-256
      encryption, 5 multi-threaded compression levels, and content-aware
      file fragment level deduplication. For backups it adds only files
      whose date has changed, and keeps both old and new versions. You can roll
      back the archive date to restore from old versions of the archive.
      The default compression level is faster than zip usually with better
      compression. zpaq uses a self-describing compressed format to allow
      for future improvements without breaking compatibility with older
      versions of the program.
