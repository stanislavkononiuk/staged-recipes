  summary: Compares k samples using the Anderson-Darling test, Kruskal-Wallis type tests  with
    different rank score criteria, Steel's multiple comparison test, and the  Jonckheere-Terpstra
    (JT) test. It computes asymptotic, simulated or (limited) exact  P-values, all valid
    under randomization, with or without ties, or conditionally  under random sampling
    from populations, given the observed tie pattern.  Except for  Steel's test and
    the JT test it also combines these tests across several blocks of  samples.  Also
    analyzed are 2 x t contingency tables and their blocked combinations  using the
    Kruskal-Wallis criterion.  Steel's test is inverted to provide simultaneous  confidence
    bounds for shift parameters.  A plotting function compares tail probabilities obtained
    under asymptotic approximation with those obtained via simulation or exact  calculations.
