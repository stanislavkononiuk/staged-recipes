  summary: Provides meta-analysis methods that correct for publication bias and outcome reporting
    bias. Four methods and a visual tool are currently included in the package. The
    p-uniform method as described in van Assen, van Aert, and Wicherts (2015) <https:psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-48759-001>
    can be used for estimating the average effect size, testing the null hypothesis
    of no effect, and testing for publication bias using only the statistically significant
    effect sizes of primary studies. The second method in the package is the p-uniform*
    method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2019) <doi:10.31222/osf.io/zqjr9>.
    This method is an extension of the p-uniform method that allows for estimation of
    the average effect size and the between-study variance in a meta-analysis, and uses
    both the statistically significant and nonsignificant effect sizes. The third method
    in the package is the hybrid method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2017)
    <doi:10.3758/s13428-017-0967-6>. The hybrid method is a meta-analysis method for
    combining an original study and replication and while taking into account statistical
    significance of the  original study. The p-uniform and hybrid method are based on
    the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform conditional
    on the population effect size. The fourth method in the package is the Snapshot
    Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2018)
    <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0175302>. This method computes posterior probabilities
    for four true effect sizes (no, small, medium, and large) based on an original study
    and replication while taking into account publication bias in the original study.
    The method can also be used for computing the required sample size of the replication
    akin to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing. The meta-plot is
    a visual tool for meta-analysis that provides information on the primary studies
    in the meta-analysis, the results of the meta-analysis, and characteristics of the
    research on the effect under study (van Assen et al., 2021). Helper functions to
    apply the Correcting for Outcome Reporting Bias (CORB) method to correct for outcome
    reporting bias in a meta-analysis (van Aert & Wicherts, 2021).
