  summary: 'Single-document unsupervised keyword extraction'
  description: |
    Unsupervised Approach for Automatic Keyword Extraction using Text Features.
    YAKE! is a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests 
    on text statistical features extracted from single documents to select the most important 
    keywords of a text. Our system does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, 
    neither it depends on dictionaries, external-corpus, size of the text, language or domain. 
    To demonstrate the merits and the significance of our proposal, we compare it against ten 
    state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches (TF.IDF, KP-Miner, RAKE, TextRank, SingleRank, ExpandRank, 
    TopicRank, TopicalPageRank, PositionRank and MultipartiteRank), and one supervised method (KEA). 
    Experimental results carried out on top of twenty datasets (see Benchmark section below) show that 
    our methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods under a number of collections of 
    different sizes, languages or domains. In addition to the python package here described, we also 
    make available a demo, an API and a mobile app.
