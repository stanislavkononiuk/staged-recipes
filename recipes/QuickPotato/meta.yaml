  description: |
    QuickPotato is a Python library that aims to make it easier to rapidly
     profile your software and produce powerful code visualizations that enables
     you to quickly investigate where potential performance bottlenecks are
     hidden. Also, QuickPotato is trying to provide you with a path to add an
     automated performance testing angle to your regular unit tests or
     test-driven development test cases allowing you to test your code early in
     the development life cycle in a simple, reliable, and fast way.\
