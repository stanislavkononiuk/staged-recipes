  # From what I can they, they compile alot of opensource go code into
  # statically linked libraries. This code migth be using protobuf 3.7.0.....
  # lets ignore that for now.
  #
  # I can't actually build the whole thing myself because they use a private
  # library in their build
  #
  # https://gitlab.com/zaber-core-libs/zaber-motion-lib/issues/1
  #
  # This statically linked code becomes this binary package, which they create
  # universal wheels for, even though the package isn't a universal wheel.
  #
  # because I don't feel like patching their code too much, I'm just leaving
  # the packages as is.  It could be that this is incompatible with
  # conda-forge's cos6
