  summary: 'Make self-extractable archives on Unix'
  description: |
    makeself.sh is a small shell script that generates a self-extractable
    compressed tar archive from a directory. The resulting file appears as a
    shell script (many of those have a .run suffix), and can be launched as is.
    The archive will then uncompress itself to a temporary directory and an
    optional arbitrary command will be executed (for example an installation
    script). This is pretty similar to archives generated with WinZip
    Self-Extractor in the Windows world. Makeself archives also include
    checksums for integrity self-validation (CRC and/or MD5/SHA256 checksums).
