  summary: The maybe type represents the possibility of some value or nothing. It is often used
    instead of throwing an error or returning `NULL`. The advantage of using a maybe
    type over `NULL` is that it is both composable and requires the developer to explicitly
    acknowledge the potential absence of a value, helping to avoid the existence of
    unexpected behaviour.
