  summary: 'Fast and scalable MCMC for all your exoplanet needs'
  description: |
    exoplanet is a toolkit for probabilistic modeling of transit and/or radial
    velocity observations of exoplanets and other astronomical time series using
    PyMC3. PyMC3 is a flexible and high-performance model building language and
    inference engine that scales well to problems with a large number of
    parameters. exoplanet extends PyMC3's language to support many of the custom
    functions and distributions required when fitting exoplanet datasets.
