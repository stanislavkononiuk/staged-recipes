  summary: "Statistical methods for the modeling and monitoring of time series of counts, proportions
    and categorical data, as well as for the modeling of continuous-time point processes
    of epidemic phenomena. The monitoring methods focus on aberration detection in count
    data time series from public health surveillance of communicable diseases, but applications
    could just as well originate from environmetrics, reliability engineering, econometrics,
    or social sciences. The package implements many typical outbreak detection procedures
    such as the (improved) Farrington algorithm, or the negative binomial GLR-CUSUM
    method of H\xF6hle and Paul (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.015>. A novel CUSUM
    approach combining logistic and multinomial logistic modeling is also included.
    The package contains several real-world data sets, the ability to simulate outbreak
    data, and to visualize the results of the monitoring in a temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal
    fashion. A recent overview of the available monitoring procedures is given by Salmon
    et al. (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i10>. For the retrospective analysis of epidemic
    spread, the package provides three endemic-epidemic modeling frameworks with tools
    for visualization, likelihood inference, and simulation. hhh4() estimates models
    for (multivariate) count time series following Paul and Held (2011) <doi:10.1002/sim.4177>
    and Meyer and Held (2014) <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743>. twinSIR() models the susceptible-infectious-recovered
    (SIR) event history of a fixed population, e.g, epidemics across farms or networks,
    as a multivariate point process as proposed by H\xF6hle (2009) <doi:10.1002/bimj.200900050>.
    twinstim() estimates self-exciting point process models for a spatio-temporal point
    pattern of infective events, e.g., time-stamped geo-referenced surveillance data,
    as proposed by Meyer et al. (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01684.x>. A recent
    overview of the implemented space-time modeling frameworks for epidemic phenomena
    is given by Meyer et al. (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i11>."
