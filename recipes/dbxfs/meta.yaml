  summary: 'User-space file system for Dropbox'
  description: |
    dbxfs allows you to mount your Dropbox folder as if it were a local
    filesystem. It differs from the official Dropbox client in two main ways:

    - Internet connectivity is required for access
    - No disk space is required for access, but will cache if disk space is
      available

    dbxfs has been tested on OpenBSD, Linux, and macOS but it should run on
    any POSIX system that provides a FUSE-compatible library or has the ability
    to mount SMB shares. Windows support is coming very soon. It runs on
    non-x86 architectures like ARM. It doesnâ€™t require a specific file system.
