  summary: Functions to calculate power and sample size for testing main effect or interaction
    effect in the survival analysis of epidemiological studies (non-randomized studies),
    taking into account the correlation between the covariate of the interest and other
    covariates. Some calculations also take into account the competing risks and stratified
    analysis. This package also includes a set of functions to calculate power and sample
    size for testing main effect in the survival analysis of randomized clinical trials
    and conditional logistic regression for nested case-control study.
