  summary: 'A post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper.'
  description: |
    unpaper is a post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper, 
    especially for book pages that have been scanned from previously
    created photocopies. The main purpose is to make scanned book pages 
    better readable on screen after conversion to PDF. Additionally, 
    unpaper might be useful to enhance the quality of scanned pages 
    before performing optical character recognition (OCR).
