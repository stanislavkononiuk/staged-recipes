  summary: 'Elastic is a set of python routines for calculation of elastic properties of crystals'

  description: |
     Elastic is a set of python routines for calculation of elastic properties 
     of crystals (elastic constants, equation of state, sound velocities, etc.). 
     It is a third version of the in-house code I have written over few years 
     and is implemented as a extension to the ASE system. 
     The code was a basis for some of my publications and was described briefly 
     in these papers. The code was available to anyone, presented at the Workshop 
     on ab initio Calculations in Geosciences and used by some of my co-workers. 
     This code is a re-implementation of elastic as a module for the ASE.
