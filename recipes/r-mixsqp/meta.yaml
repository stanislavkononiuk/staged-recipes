  license: MIT
  summary: Provides optimization algorithms based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for
    maximum likelihood estimation of the mixture proportions in a finite mixture model
    where the component densities are known. The algorithms are expected to obtain solutions
    that are at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art MOSEK interior-point solver
    (called by function "KWDual" in the 'REBayes' package), and they are expected to
    arrive at solutions more quickly in large data sets. The algorithms are described
    in Y. Kim, P. Carbonetto, M. Stephens & M. Anitescu (2012) <arXiv:1806.01412>.
