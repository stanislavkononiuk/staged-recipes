  description: |
    This package offers functions for calculating several E-statistics
    such as:
    - Estimator of the energy distance.
    - Biased and unbiased estimators of distance covariance and
    distance correlation.
    - Estimators of the partial distance covariance and partial
    distance covariance.
    It also provides tests based on these E-statistics:
    - Test of homogeneity based on the energy distance.
    - Test of independence based on distance covariance.
