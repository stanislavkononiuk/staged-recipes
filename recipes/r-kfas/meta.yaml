  summary: State space modelling is an efficient and flexible framework for  statistical inference
    of a broad class of time series and other data. KFAS  includes computationally efficient
    functions for Kalman filtering, smoothing,  forecasting, and simulation of multivariate
    exponential family state space models,  with observations from Gaussian, Poisson,
    binomial, negative binomial, and gamma  distributions. See the paper by Helske (2017)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v078.i10> for details.
