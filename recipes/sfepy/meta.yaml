  summary: "Simple finite elements in Python"
  description: >-
    SfePy is a software for solving systems of coupled partial
    differential equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 1D,
    2D and 3D. It can be viewed both as black-box PDE solver, and as a
    Python package which can be used for building custom
    applications. The word simple means that complex FEM problems can
    be coded very easily and rapidly.
