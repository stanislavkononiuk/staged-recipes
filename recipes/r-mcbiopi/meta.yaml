  summary: Computes the prime implicants or a minimal disjunctive normal form for a logic expression
    presented by a truth table or a logic tree. Has been particularly  developed for
    logic expressions resulting from a logic regression analysis, i.e. logic expressions
    typically consisting of up to 16 literals, where the prime implicants  are typically
    composed of a maximum of 4 or 5 literals.
