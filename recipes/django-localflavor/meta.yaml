  summary: 'django-localflavor is a collection of assorted pieces of code that are useful for particular countries or cultures. These are called the "local flavor" add-ons'

  description: |
    Most of the localflavor add-ons are localized form components deriving from the forms framework â€“ for example, a USStateField that knows how to validate U.S. state abbreviations, and a FISocialSecurityNumber that knows how to validate Finnish social security numbers.
