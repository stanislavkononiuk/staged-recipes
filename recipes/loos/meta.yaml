  summary: 'The Lightweight Object Oriented Structure analysis Library'
  description: |
    LOOS is a C++ library for developing new tools to analyze molecular
    dynamics simulations. It is designed to provide good performance while
    greatly simplifying the process of creating new methods, particularly when
    using its python interface. This package contains roughly 100 useful tools,
    as well as the python bindings needed to create new tools. If you wish to 
    write a new C++ tool or modify the library itself, we recommend you instead 
    clone LOOS from GitHub.
