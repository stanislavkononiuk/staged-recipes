  summary: 'Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes. Currently, four methodologies
    are implemented: A modified t-test to perform hypothesis testing about the independence
    between the processes, a suitable nonparametric correlation coefficient, the codispersion
    coefficient, and an F test for assessing the multiple correlation between one spatial
    process and several others. SpatialPack gives methods to complement methodologies
    that are available in geoR for one spatial process.'
