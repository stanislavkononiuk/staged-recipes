  summary: 'Displays installed python packages in form of a dependency tree.'
  description: |
    pipdeptree is a command line utility for displaying the
    installed python packages in form of a dependency tree. It works for packages
    installed globally on a machine as well as in a virtualenv. Since pip freeze
    shows all dependencies as a flat list, finding out which are the top level
    packages and which packages do they depend on requires some effort. It can also
    be tedious to resolve conflicting dependencies because pip doesn't yet have
    true dependency resolution (more on this later). This utility tries to solve
    this problem.
