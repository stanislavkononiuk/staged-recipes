  description: |
    Ibis is a Python framework to write data analytics code, in a similar way
    to pandas. Ibis can execute the queries not only in memory
    (as pandas does), but in different backends, including SQL databases,
    and analytics databases, like HeavyDB. HeavyDB is SQL-based, relational,
    columnar and specifically developed to harness the massive parallelism of
    modern CPU and GPU hardware. OmniSciDB can query up to billions of rows in
    milliseconds, and is capable of unprecedented ingestion speeds, making it
    the ideal SQL engine for the era of big, high-velocity data.
