  summary: Utility functions that enhance the 'parallel' package and support the built-in parallel
    backends of the 'future' package.  For example, availableCores() gives the number
    of CPU cores available to your R process as given by R options and environment variables,
    including those set by job schedulers on high-performance compute clusters. If none
    is set, it will fall back to parallel::detectCores(). Another example is makeClusterPSOCK(),
    which is backward compatible with parallel::makePSOCKcluster() while doing a better
    job in setting up remote cluster workers without the need for configuring the firewall
    to do port-forwarding to your local computer.
