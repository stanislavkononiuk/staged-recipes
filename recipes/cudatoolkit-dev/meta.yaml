  summary: "Develop, Optimize and Deploy GPU-accelerated Apps"
  description: |
    The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit provides a development environment for creating 
    high performance GPU-accelerated applications. With the CUDA Toolkit, 
    you can develop, optimize and deploy your applications on GPU-accelerated
    embedded systems, desktop workstations, enterprise data centers, 
    cloud-based platforms and HPC supercomputers. The toolkit includes 
    GPU-accelerated libraries, debugging and optimization tools, 
    a C/C++ compiler and a runtime library to deploy your application.
    This package consists of a post-install script that downloads and 
    installs the full cuda toolkit.
