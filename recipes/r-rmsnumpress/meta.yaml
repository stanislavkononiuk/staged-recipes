  summary: '''Rcpp'' bindings to the native C++ implementation of MS Numpress, that provides
    two compression schemes for numeric data from mass spectrometers. The library provides
    implementations of 3 different algorithms, 1 designed to compress first order smooth
    data like retention time or M/Z arrays, and 2 for compressing non smooth data with
    lower requirements on precision like ion count arrays. Refer to the publication
    (Teleman et al., (2014) <doi:10.1074/mcp.O114.037879>) for more details.'
