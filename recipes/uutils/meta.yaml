  summary: 'Cross-platform Rust rewrite of the GNU coreutils'
  description: |
    uutils is an attempt at writing universal (as in cross-platform) CLI utilities in Rust.
    uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible,
    to be able to use the same utils on Linux, Mac, Windows and other platforms.
    This ensures, for example, that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.
    Rust was chosen not only because it is fast and safe,
    but is also excellent for writing cross-platform code.
