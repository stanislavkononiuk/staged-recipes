about:
  home: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SEL
  license: GPL
  summary: This package implements a novel method for fitting a bounded probability distribution
    to quantiles (for example stated by an expert), see Bornkamp and Ickstadt (2009)
    for details.  For this purpose B-splines are used, and the density is obtained by
    penalized least squares based on a Brier entropy penalty.  The package provides
    methods for fitting the distribution as well as methods for evaluating the underlying
    density and cdf. In addition methods for plotting the distribution, drawing random
    numbers and calculating quantiles of the obtained distribution are provided.
