  summary: A light-weight package helps you track and visualize the progress of parallel version
    of vectorized R functions (mc*apply). Parallelization (mc.core > 1) works only on
    *nix (Linux, Unix such as macOS) system due to the lack of fork() functionality,
    which is essential for mc*apply, on Windows.
