  summary: Natrual language processing data Augmentation library
  description: |
    This python library helps you with augmenting NLP for your machine learning
     projects. `Augmenter` is the basic element of augmentation while `Flow` is
     a pipeline to orchestra multi augmenter together. Nlpaug generates
     synthetic data for improving model performance without manual effort. It is
     a simple and easy-to-use and lightweight library where you can augment data
     in 3 lines of code, and features plug and play to any machine leanring
     and neural network frameworks (e.g. scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow).
     Nlpaug supports textual and audio input as well.
