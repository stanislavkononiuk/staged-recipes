  summary: A suite of functions for conducting and interpreting analysis of statistical interaction
    in regression models that was formerly part of the 'jtools' package. Functionality
    includes visualization of two- and three-way interactions among continuous and/or
    categorical variables as well as calculation of "simple slopes" and Johnson-Neyman
    intervals (see e.g., Bauer & Curran, 2005 <doi:10.1207/s15327906mbr4003_5>). These
    capabilities are implemented for generalized linear models in addition to the standard
    linear regression context.
