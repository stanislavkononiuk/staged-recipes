# Package: DGEobj
# Type: Package
# Title: Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis Results Data Object
# Version: 1.1.2
# Description: Provides a flexible container to manage and annotate Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis results (Smythe et. al (2015) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkv007>). The DGEobj has data slots for row (gene), col (samples), assays (matrix n-rows by m-samples dimensions) and metadata (not keyed to row, col, or assays). A set of accessory functions to deposit, query and retrieve subsets of a data workflow has been provided.  Attributes are used to capture metadata such as species and gene model, including reproducibility information such that a 3rd party can access a DGEobj history to see how each data object was created or modified.  Since the DGEobj is customizable and extensible it is not limited to RNA-seq analysis types of workflows -- it can accommodate nearly any data analysis workflow that starts from a matrix of assays (rows) by samples (columns).
