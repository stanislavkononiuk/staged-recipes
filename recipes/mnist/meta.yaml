  summary: 'Python utilities to download and parse the MNIST dataset'
  description: |
    The MNIST database is available at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

    The MNIST database is a dataset of handwritten digits. It has 60,000 training
    samples, and 10,000 test samples. Each image is represented by 28x28 pixels, each
    containing a value 0 - 255 with its grayscale value.

    It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST.
    The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

    It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition
    methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

    There are four files available, which contain separately train and test, and images and labels.

    Thanks to Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, Christopher J.C. Burges
