  summary: 'A general-purpose forward-time population genetics simulation environment'
  description: |
    simuPOP is a forward-time population genetics simulation environment. The
    core of simuPOP is a scripting language (Python) that provides a large 
    number of objects and functions to manipulate populations, and a mechanism
    to evolve populations forward in time. Using this R/Splus-like environment,
    users can create, manipulate and evolve populations interactively, or write
    a script and run it as a batch file. Owing to its flexible and extensible design,
    simuPOP can simulate large and complex evolutionary processes with ease. At 
    a more user-friendly level, simuPOP provides an increasing number of built-in
    scripts that perform simulations ranging from implementation of basic population
    genetics models to generating datasets under complex evolutionary scenarios.
