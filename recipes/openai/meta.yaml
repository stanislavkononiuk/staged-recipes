  summary: Python client library for the OpenAI API
  description: |
    The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API
    from applications written in the Python language.
    It includes a pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize
    themselves dynamically from API responses which makes it compatible with
    a wide range of versions of the OpenAI API.

    This library additionally provides an `openai` command-line utility which
    makes it easy to interact with the API from your terminal.
    Run `openai api -h` for usage.
