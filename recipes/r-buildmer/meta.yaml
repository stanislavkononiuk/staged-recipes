  summary: "Finds the largest possible regression model that will still converge for various
    types of regression analyses (including mixed models and generalized additive models)
    and then optionally performs stepwise elimination similar to the forward and backward
    effect-selection methods in SAS, based on the change in log-likelihood or its significance,
    Akaike's Information Criterion, the Bayesian Information Criterion, the explained
    deviance, or the F-test of the change in R\xB2."
