  summary: 'Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) Macroscale Hydrologic Model'
  description: |
    VIC (Liang et al., 1994) is a macroscale hydrologic model that solves full
    water and energy balances, originally developed by Xu Liang at the University
    of Washington. VIC is a research model and in its various forms it has been
    applied to most of the major river basins around the world, as well a
    globally.
