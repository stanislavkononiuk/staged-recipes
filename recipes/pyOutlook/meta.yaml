  summary: 'A Python module for connecting to the Outlook REST API'
  description: |
    pyOutlook was created after I found myself attempting to connect to
    the Outlook REST API in multiple projects. This provided some much
    needed uniformity. Itâ€™s easier to deal with than the win32com package
    by Microsoft, but obviously has a far smaller scope.
