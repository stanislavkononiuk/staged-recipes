  summary: 'LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of equations'
  description: |
      The CLAPACK library was built using a Fortran to C 
      conversion utility called f2c. The entire Fortran 77 
      LAPACK library is run through f2c to obtain C code, 
      and then modified to improve readability. CLAPACK's 
      goal is to provide LAPACK for someone who does not have 
      access to a Fortran compiler.
