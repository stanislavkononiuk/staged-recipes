  summary: Captures and compiles the genes and variants related to a disease, a phenotype or
    a clinical feature from the public databases including HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology,
    <http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/about.html>), Orphanet <http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/index.php>,
    OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, <http://www.omim.org>), ClinVar <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar>,
    and UniProt (Universal Protein Resource, <http://www.uniprot.org>) and PubMed abstracts.
    HPO provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in
    human disease. HPO currently contains approximately 11,000 terms and over 115,000
    annotations to hereditary diseases. Orphanet is the reference portal for information
    on rare diseases and orphan drugs, whose aim is to help improve the diagnosis, care
    and treatment of patients with rare diseases. OMIM is a continuously updated catalog
    of human genes and genetic disorders and traits, with particular focus on the molecular
    relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic expression. ClinVar is a freely
    accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations
    and phenotypes, with supporting evidence. UniProt focuses on amino acid altering
    variants imported from Ensembl Variation databases. For Homo sapiens, the variants
    including human polymorphisms and disease mutations in the UniProt are manually
    curated  from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Additionally, PubMed provides the primary and
    latest source of the information. Text mining was employed to capture the information
    from PubMed abstracts.
