  summary: Contains the Markov cluster algorithm (MCL) for identifying clusters in networks and
    graphs. The algorithm simulates random walks on a (n x n) matrix as the adjacency
    matrix of a graph. It alternates an expansion step and an inflation step until an
    equilibrium state is reached.
