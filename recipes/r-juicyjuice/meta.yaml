  summary: There are occasions where you need a piece of HTML with integrated styles. A prime
    example of this is HTML email. This transformation involves moving the CSS and associated
    formatting instructions from the style block in the head of your document into the
    body of the HTML. Many prominent email clients require integrated styles in HTML
    email; otherwise a received HTML email will be displayed without any styling. This
    package will quickly and precisely perform these CSS transformations when given
    HTML text and it does so by using the JavaScript 'juice' library.
