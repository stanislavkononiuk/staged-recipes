  summary: Host software for AirSpy HF+, a high performance SDR for the HF and VHF bands
  description: |
    Airspy is a line of Popular Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receivers
    developed to achieve High Performance and Affordable Price using innovative
    combinations of DSP and RF techniques. The goal is to satisfy the most
    demanding telecommunications professionals and radio enthusiasts while
    being a serious alternative to both cost sensitive and higher end
    receivers. Airspy Radios feature world class reception quality and ease of
    use thanks to the tight integration with the de facto standard free SDR#
    software for signal acquisition, analysis and demodulation.

    The `libairspyhf` package contains the library for Airspy HF+ devices, and
    the `airspyhf` package contains command line tools for using the devices.

    For Linux users of `airspyhf`, you will likely want to link the provided
    udev rule into your system installation in order for the hardware to have
    the correct permissions:

        sudo ln -s $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/udev/rules.d/52-airspyhf.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
        sudo udevadm control --reload
        sudo udevadm trigger

    Then, make sure your user account belongs to the plugdev group in order to
    be able to access your device:

        sudo usermod -a -G plugdev <user>

    You may have to restart for this change to take effect.
