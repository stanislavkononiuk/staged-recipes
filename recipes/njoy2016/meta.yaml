build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  # More info about selectors can be found in the conda-build docs: 
  # https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#preprocessing-selectors

test:
  # Some packages might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.
  imports:

  # For python packages, it is useful to run pip check. However, sometimes the
  # metadata used by pip is out of date. Thus this section is optional if it is
  # failing.

  summary: 'Nuclear Data Processing System'
  description: |
    The NJOY Nuclear Data Processing System is a modular computer code designed
    to read evaluated data in ENDF format, transform the data in various ways,
    and output the results as libraries designed to be used in various applications.
    Each module performs a well defined processing task. The modules are essentially
    independent programs, and they communicate with each other using input and
    output files, plus a very few common variables.
