  description: |
    Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the
    one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip can compress about as fast as gzip (lzip -0),
    or compress most files more than bzip2 (lzip -9). Decompression speed is
    intermediate between gzip and bzip2. Lzip is better than gzip and bzip2
    from a data recovery perspective.
