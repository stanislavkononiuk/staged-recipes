  summary: 'A tetrahedral mesh generator based on Jonathon Shewchuks isosurface stuffing algorithm in combination with the A15 acute tetrahedral tile.'
  description: |
    Quartet converts a watertight triangle mesh into a high-quality uniform 
    tetrahedral mesh that closely approximates the geometry, up to the curvature 
    implied by the specified grid sampling (dx). Optionally, the tetrahedral mesh 
    can be warped to match sharp features on the input, and also improved by a 
    quality optimization pass.
