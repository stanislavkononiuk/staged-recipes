  description: |
    Did you ever think that most of your test functions were actually the same
    test code, but with different data inputs and expected results/exceptions ?
    `pytest-cases` leverages `pytest` and its great `@pytest.mark.parametrize`
    decorator, so that you can separate your test cases from your test
    functions. In addition, `pytest-cases` provides several useful goodies to
    empower `pytest`. In particular it improves the fixture mechanism to support
    "fixture unions". This is a major change in the internal `pytest` engine,
    unlocking many possibilities such as using fixture references as parameter
    values in a test function.
