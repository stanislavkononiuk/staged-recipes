  summary: An interactive image editing tool that can be added as part of the HTML in Shiny,
    R markdown or any type of HTML document. Often times, plots, photos are embedded
    in the web application/file. 'drawer' can take screenshots of these image-like elements,
    or any part of the HTML document and send to an image editing space called 'canvas'
    to allow users immediately edit the screenshot(s) within the same document. Users
    can quickly combine, compare different screenshots, upload their own images and
    maybe make a scientific figure.
